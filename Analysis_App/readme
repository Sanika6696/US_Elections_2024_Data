## Project Title
**Tracking Political Sentiments: Analyzing Election-Driven Discussions on Reddit and 4chan**

---
## Project Overview
This project examines the dynamics of online discourse during the 2024 U.S. presidential election by analyzing sentiment, engagement, and behavioral patterns on Reddit and 4chan. It provides insights into how political events influence public sentiment and interaction across these platforms.

Our implementation focuses on answering the following research questions:
1. **What key entities and topics emerge from flagged toxic comments on different subreddits and 4chan’s /pol/ board, and what do they reveal about online toxicity??**
2. **What is the relationship between sentiment levels (polarity and subjectivity) and the content of online discussions, based on the analysis of comments?**
3. **What dominant terms and underlying themes emerge from analyzing flagged toxic comments in high-toxicity, high-engagement discussions?**

This project delivers a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** that provides interactive querying and results visualization for the analyses.

### **1. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Analysis** 
- Extracts and categorizes entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) from toxic comments on Reddit and 4chan.
- Uses `spaCy` for NER to classify entities by type (e.g., PERSON, EVENT, NORP) and presents them in an interactive dropdown format.
- Allows users to explore entities by type for a specified date range or all available data.
- Results are saved in HTML format, enabling easy exploration and analysis of flagged toxic comments.

- **Reddit Command**
  ```bash
  python3 reddit_analyzer/reddit_toxicity_analyzer.py --analysis-type="NER" --date-range="ALL" --output reddit_analyzer/ner_date_range_all_results.html
