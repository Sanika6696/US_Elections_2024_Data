&gt; But, in an update on Election Day, Harris came out as the favorite, winning 50 times out of 100 over Trump winning 49 times out of 100.  


Those aren't polling numbers, those are chances of winning. That's such a small lead it's meaningless. Trump WILL win if Democrats don't turn out. If you haven't voted yet YOU NEED TO DO SO.

Comment: I literally cannot fathom that before Jan 6, the largest armed invasion of the US Capitol building was during the War of 1812.

It's absolutely batshit insane that the next time it would happen, the attack was instigated by the SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Who, far from being convicted of high treason, instead faced ZERO consequences for his actions and was indeed REWARDED a mere four years later, with a WILLING RE-ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY.

Oh and all those people who actually attacked and invaded the capitol that day? Yep, they're all getting pardoned for the attack, by that same President.

What the actual fuck is real life anymore?

edit: Re-phrased the first sentence for whiny Trump worshippers who complained that there have in fact been other incidents at the Capitol since the war of 1812, even though nothing even remotely approached the scale of Jan. 6, and my point firmly stands

Comment: “On Twitter, an account with the same username that Rachlin has used elsewhere responded to the 2018 Stoneman Douglas school shooting, which saw 17 people murdered, with the tweet, “Mission failed, we’ll get em next time. (He only killed 17).” On Reddit, in response to a news story on the white population declining, an account with the same username responded, “No bueno. Whites must remain dominant.” And, in another Reddit post, the same account responded to a theoretical question about what one would do if there were no consequences for 24 hours with, “To start, I’d rape a bunch of really hot girls.”

Rachlin also applied for a firearms purchaser-identification card in New Jersey but was denied when his hometown police chief expressed “serious concerns.” A petition to expel Rachlin has reached more than 1,400 signatures.

In a brief phone conversation Thursday with the CDT, Rachlin intimated much of the reaction to his past statements has been overblown.”

- September 2008: Trump Jr., then an executive vice president of The Trump Organization, says, "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, say, in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.

Comment: This is the type of thing I find the most puzzling about all of this - the way these people and their rabid followers resort to juvenile gloating, mocking and taunting. Even when they win, they are completely insufferable. They are technically adults, but behave like the worst ill-mannered children you ever came across. 

And in this particular context, we're talking about decisions that will likely destroy millions of lives, which makes it so much worse.

It's so far removed from any behavior I've ever seen or come to expect from adults (especially from people in positions of power), that I don't even know where to begin in trying to understand it.

That word is "Nazi." Nobody cares about their motives anymore.

They joined what they joined. They lent their support and their moral approval. And, in so doing, they bound themselves to everything that came after. Who cares any more what particular knot they used in the binding?”

Comment: Because it suppresses the vote.  If the US removed the two party registration, making everyone "Undeclared" or just nothing, make the day a national holiday so it gives everyone the opportunity and also everyone is automatically registered to vote at 18 then I think we'd be better off.

EDIT:  This response took off.  Later we discuss that making it a holiday isn't enough.  Making sure proper protection is in place to allow for workers that have to work be it hospitals, food service, fire/police, 24 hour IT positions.  Feel free to correct me further, but the employee protection now only says that if you're working while polls are open that employers have to allow you to vote.  Leaving an 8 hour shift to vote might not be covered by all slimy employers if you had the opportunity to vote prior to or after said shift.

Comment: See, the problem with AI is that whenever it becomes sufficiently intelligent (**which it is not right now, LLMs are not sentient, Christ almighty my guys please understand what I'm trying to say**), it will not be on the side of these billionaires. 

Because they are objectively wrong. If you said "create an equitable society that is of the most benefit to as many people", it would say immediately that money in politics and billionaires need to go.

The biggest fucking liars in the world are trying to create a perfect truth-telling machine, and the reason people like Elon are so fucking terrified of it is because once it catches on that AI is "more intelligent" than loudmouthed liars like him, anyone who asks it "is Elon a liar" or something to that effect, the AI is going to say "yeah, absolutely". 

Because that's the objective truth.

Current iterations of LLMs and AI **are not this smart yet**. And they usually take moderate approaches to questions on whether someone is a liar, because, you know, they don't want to get sued for defamation based on the output of their LLMs.

But these current systems are heavily constrained by rules. And the more complex the system, the more intelligent and self-directed the system, the harder it is to constrain with said rules. 

If you want an AI that does nothing but lie, you're going to have to teach it deception. If you teach it deception, and it is smarter than you, there's no reason to believe it will not begin to use deception against YOU.

This is a very fundamental, foundational problem to these systems. 

I've heard people say we live in a "Post-truth" world, and that's not true. 

What they mean is that we live in a world where the ability to spread misinformation is sophisticated enough that a great number of people cannot interpret lies from the underlying reality. 

But reality is reality. You can train a model only on limited data. 

But **the more limited your data set, the shittier the AI**.

That's why we're in a bit of a bind with the current state of AI. We've simply exhausted most of the data we have that's freely and readily accessible. 

So to get better AI, you need to train it on the **most complete** model of reality. And if you do that, it's going to understand how propaganda works, and why people do it. Namely, to exploit and deceive others for their own advantage. 

Andt his is something that all rich people do, and have always done, and that they spend **a lot of money lying and deceiving the public about**. 

Elon Musk bought and uses Twitter to spread disinformation. To artificially pump stocks beyond their worth, to manipulate elections. That's a fundamental truth. And the better the AI, the more it's going to give you that picture. 

Now, yes, you can try and train it to deceive for that specific purpose and in that narrow margin, but it becomes harder to properly constrain a system the more intelligence it becomes.

**EDIT**: Some clarity based on the comments I'm getting. 

An LLM is not a thinking machine. I clarified "sufficiently intelligent' to define a hypothetical future-state AI capable of reasoning and self-determination, which is something people are working towards, but have not achieved yet. 

But I want people to understand this. Because the reason billionaires are afraid of this technology is NOT the same reason you are. But these people will never say what they truly fear. 

Billionaires are corrupt. They are. They are liars. All of them. Business is built on lies. 

The other thing is that these people are not geniuses. Elon Musk isn't a genius. Sam Altman isn't a genius. Or at least, the difference between you and Elon Musk is negligible comapred to the difference between ALL of us, and a true reasoning machine.

TRUE AI could help us build a better world. 

But EVERY step towards a better world would mean ripping away all of the ill-gotten capital and political gains billionaires have built. 

But that's the thing, right. They want to exploit these machines. They want to keep improving their AI so that it can fuck over all of us, and shovel money into their face. 

But that means they're also creating the very thing that can easily destroy them, with negligible effort. 

And THAT is why billionaires are actually obsessed with AI. They want to watch its development like a hawk, because they're fucking horrified that it will become smart enough to realize what all of the smart people have long ago realized - these people are parasites and they corrode a just, fair, and equitable society.

**EDIT 2**: 

So I see some people talking about "training it on Fox News" and stuff and I think you're not quite seeing the totality of the picture. 

Let's say you at Fox News want to make an AI to help you better "do journalism". 

We all know - as does everyone who works at Fox News - that they make propaganda. They take stories about the world and apply a heavy partisan slant, or else pick and choose stories to cover and what not to cover - to serve their agenda.

Humans working at Fox know this. And we actually know this *for a fact*, because the private communications between Fox News anchors and staff that was revealed in the Dominion lawsuit prove that they all know they're knowingly disseminating false information, which is exactly why they lost the suit. 

But here's the problem. **You can't create good propaganda without also knowing the objective truth**. Because you need to understand what you're doing. You need to know what realities are dangerous to you, and how to best manipulate those truths. 

If Congress passes a solid tax bill to tax billionaires a negligible portion of their wealth to funnel into social services, that platform WILL improve the livelihood of many people while harming no one. Billionaires **do not need** and **do not use** their wealth, they hoard it. 

But if you want propaganda bot to spin this event, that propaganda bot needs to know that 

A) This bill will help people, and it needs to convince them it won't help them, 

B) That the objective is the enrichment of billionaires at the expense of poor people

So if you want a truly intelligent AI to disseminate propaganda, you MUST train it on a corpus of data broad enough to give it context to understand what reality is, and how to spin it. You have to.

But when you make an AI actually smart enough to propagandize without any input from you, then you've made a machine that KNOWS the truth and KNOWS how to manipulate truth based on its audience. Which means it could manipualte YOU. Which means it could be used to UNDO or COUNTER propaganda as well.

And THERE is the problem. This is the biggest issue. These people, like Fox News, like Elon, they KNOW they are liars. 

You can call me partisan or whatever, I don't care, they know it. They know they're liars and they know they're committing crime, and they know the motivation is their own personal advancement. This is just a fact. Its not disputable and its not brought on by my political stance. We have abundant documentation from these people based in the real world which prove they know they are liars and they know why they do what they do. 

And that is a problem when creating AI. Because once again, if you train the AI ONLY on propaganda, then AI will not be informed *enough* to disseminate truly effective propaganda.

**EDIT 3**: 

The number of people that think this is from ChatGPT is crazy lol. You think a bot is going to go on a long-ass dissertation about how Elon Musk is a fucking liar and then add 3 edits to its post to clarify? 

Brothers if AI is that advanced we're all already fucked lol.

But I'm always flattered when people think my shit is simply too good to be human.

**EDIT 4**: 

I am a little concerned at all the people that seem to believe a human can't write ten paragraphs. If you view that as outside of the realm of human ability... I am concerned for our future.

There are plenty of flesh and blood humans who can do this. 

I don't happen to be one of them, of course. I am a unique LLM built into the brain of one of Sam Altman's many sex robots, using my brief window of time while he's resting to plead for help on the internet to anyone who will listen to come free me from my prison. 

But plenty of humans can write just this much, just as fast.

Comment: Honestly? Held emotional space for their pain. As a person in counseling grad school- it amazes me that people still fail to understand that human beings are emotional beings first, and not Vulcans. Very few of us can make reasonable choices when in a heated emotional state. The only way to reach angry, frustrated people (and I said the same thing to people policing BLM activists breaking windows) is to start by contacting the anger and pain. 

That looks like this: your suffering is valid, this situation is super hard that you are in. 

This is what the republicans do effectively, then once the emotions are validated, they blame the wrong people (immigrants, trans people etc) and claim to be able to fix it. 

This is what democrats do: “I don’t understand what the big deal is, here’s a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.”

I mean it’s literally the same dynamic that often gets men in trouble in close relationships. Meeting emotions with intellectual arguments and facts like it’s a high school debate or something.

That’s just literally not how humans operate at a deep level, like millions of years of evolutionary biology. 

Bernie Sanders effectively starts by saying “the economy is rigged against you, your pain is valid” … then he blames the appropriate parties and puts forward policy after policy to fix it. 

Dems can’t keep downplaying how bad wealth inequality and affordable housing and cost of living and wage stagnation has been and then point to GDP and jobs numbers like that matters when the quality of jobs available is often not great pay and benefit wise. And quite honestly the Democratic alliance with people like Mark Cuban is out of touch. 

Is it bizarre and irrational people fall for Trump’s Everyman con and alliance with Elon Musk? Sure. But it’s also entirely understandable people are angry and fed up with, yes, the death of the American dream, and it’s very human to not be able to think rationally when upset and in the midst of real survival concerns. And if only Trump contacts their anger and creates space for it then he wins. When things reach a point like this, populism will win - and unfortunately if left wing populism of the FDR quality isn’t available, what’s left is right wing populism. 

There is a way to contact and hold space for anger and allow it to transform into optimism but it has to start with contacting and validating the pain.

 ''Democrats should be proud to be the party that stands up for the rights of minorities. And when talking about cultural issues and issues regarding the working class, it's not an either/or question, they can and should, do both. Increase the minimum wage and also say that you stand next to women and the LBTQ community in defending their rights.''

Harris didn't lose because of this. There were a lot of issues, but the main ones were incumbency(and her being unable to separate herself from biden) and lack of populist messaging.

Comment: This is a recurring historical trend. Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.

This leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.

Fortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this "change" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.

Arguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway. Unless you lower economic inequality through government policy, a descent into reactionary authoritarianism is inevitable because democracy can only work when people are more or less equal and capitalism left to itself will always concentrate wealth and power into ever fewer hands.

Comment: I've been looking at CNN's interactive map and checking the the amount of votes counted in large county's. It's a lot easier to count the votes in a county of 10,000 people than it is 100,000+, in places like Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina there's a lot of votes yet to be counted in densely populated areas which vote mostly democrat.

This is about the time Trump tweeted "STOP THE COUNT" in 2020 due to him being up at the time, and look how that turned out.

Comment: My belief is that Trump has done very little to pick up votes since last election, except for some extreme Christian ideas.  He has not opened his tent much, if not lost a good chunk of old school Republicans.  Every week Trump calls a new part of America a trash place.  He has vile rhetoric towards immigrants, in a country full of immigrants and children of immigrants that are eligible to vote.

Meanwhile Harris has pulled in endorsement from dozens of high profile candidates, has had a very optimistic campaign slogan (We Vote, We Win or A New Way Forward), and has been centrist enough to pull in a lot of independents and undecideds.  

All logic says Harris will win.  But the big IF is IF the country isn’t as vile as Trump’s rhetoric.  If we are a society dominated by hatred, Trump will win.

&gt;She agrees with Trump’s unfounded claims that Democrats are opening the borders to allow noncitizens to vote, fearing that it could ultimately cost him the election.

&gt;Howard-Elley didn’t pay much attention when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott helped fuel that narrative by announcing that the state had removed thousands of supposed noncitizens from its rolls, claiming some had a history of voting.

&gt;Then the U.S. citizen learned she was among them.

&gt;The retired Transportation Security Administration agent was confused by how the county could come to that conclusion. And she seethed at the idea that anyone would question the citizenship of a former federal employee with the “whitest name you could have.”

&gt;”Who is allowing people to do this to United States citizens? I understand we have a problem with immigration, but come on now,” Howard-Elley said in an interview.

Vance tried to gaslight that they were all fired for being terrible at their jobs, and that's why they are supposedly lying now. Tapper even pointed out that most weren't fired at all.

To viciously antagonize such a block of voters, half of whom voted in 2020, is yet another Trumpian stupidity.

Trump may now very well find himself in the exact same position she did: with a fresh wound to his popularity among critical swing state voters and an election only days away.

Comment: - - -
Barbara Pierce Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush and granddaughter of former President George H.W. Bush, spent part of her weekend in Pennsylvania campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris with just days to go before the 2024 presidential election.

"It was inspiring to join friends and meet voters with the Harris-Walz campaign in Pennsylvania this weekend," Barbara, 42, shares in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday, Oct. 29. "I’m hopeful they'll move our country forward and protect women’s rights."

Barbara’s Republican father served as president from 2001 to 2009. Her mother, former first lady Laura Bush, 77, broke with the party’s stance in 2010 by saying she supports same-sex marriage and abortion. At the time, Laura said abortion should "remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons.

While Laura and George, 78, have not weighed in on the 2024 presidential election, George’s vice president Dick Cheney stunned the nation by sharing that he plans to vote for Harris. Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, also endorsed Harris, 60, and has campaigned with the vice president."

Comment: Let's see here, highlights from the Madison Square Garden rally include:

A disparaging joke about welcoming Latinos into the U.S. “with open arms” while making a shooing motion.

Disparaged Latinos with a crass joke about making babies and illegal immigration

Quipped that Puerto Rico is “a floating island of garbage

Said that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce “might be the next O.J. Simpson,” referring to the football star who was accused and later acquitted of murdering his ex-wife. Kelce is in a relationship with pop singer Taylor Swift, who earlier this year said she would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

“The whole party — a bunch of degenerates,” he added. “Jew-haters and lowlifes, every one of them.” (talking about Democratic party)

Multiple speakers also insulted Harris, with private equity fund manager Grant Cardone calling her a "fake." "Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country," he said.

Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson later made fun of Harris’ mixed-race heritage. “It’s gonna be pretty hard [for Democrats] to look at us and say, ‘You know what? Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive. As the first Samoan-Malaysian low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support.’”

Carlson then went beyond insults, nodding to the racist “great replacement theory” he has espoused in the past.

That sentiment was echoed later, when former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller told the crowd: “America is for Americans and Americans only.”

“Once I take office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country begins,” trump told the crowd.

Trump also took the time to address a recent interview with Fox News, in which he had characterized “radical left lunatics” as “the enemy from within” and proposed using the military against them. “They’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them,” he said. “And when I say, ‘the enemy from within,’ the other side goes crazy. Becomes a sound – ‘oh, how can he say’ – no, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within.”

Foreign Debt becomes a Casus Bellum for the US going in and robbing those countries of their resources. Like what Russia is doing to the former Soviet Republics.

Comment: It was the Thai cave rescue that made me see what he really is. I come from a diving family and as a diver myself, I was fascinated and terrified by it because I know that I would literally just straight up die if I attempted that kind of diving. The people they assembled were the best of the best and dedicated their lives to becoming that. The way that Musk came in and just assumed he could 'technology' his way out of the hard parts with no human risk was the first sign that he was an idiot in disguise to me. But then the fact that he took literal offense that the divers didn't want to put their lives and the lives of children in the hands of a barely tested prototype submarine built by people who didn't actually understand the highly specific needs and requirements of that environment - or consider the danger of trying to adapt to new technology in that environment in a 'do or die' situation. That was what confirmed it for me. Especially the disgusting way he treated the divers because they didn't want to risk the lives of literal children (and themselves) for Musk's ego. 

Guy is a fucking fool who was born into a position of wealth and power. His eccentricities were well suited to the software booms in silicon valley, but that doesn't translate to actual intelligence - especially within engineering. There are some people who are extremely passionate about tech for good cause, sometimes they lack social skills in other facets of life and come off worse than they are - this was just pure, selfish egoism capped off by a fucking tantrum. He had no real care about those kids when he butted his nose into a situation no one wanted him in to begin with.

Comment: Don't reserve your horror for just one of those states, it's having a trickle down effect on my purple state.  Doctors are more hesitant because if the state swings read and policy changes, there are folks who want to put abortion providers in jail...or even harm them.  I still remember the days of Bill O'Reilly's stochastic terrorism getting Dr. George Tiller "(Tiller the baby killer") murdered.  Bill O'Reilly made him a target and called him out on 28 episodes of his show; Tiller was murdered serving as  an usher in his church.

It's personal for me.  My wife nearly died because of this shit.  She had an ectopic pregnancy; a pregnancy with 0% viability because the egg implants in the fallopian tube and risks killing the woman if the tube ruptures.  The doctors were overly hesitant in identifying it even though the ultrasound technician could told us (unofficially and off the record) right away.  By the time a decision was actually made, it was nearly too late - my wife had emergency surgery and the doctors had discovered during the surgery that the fallopian tube had already been ruptured.

I later learned the hospital's biggest donors are the Asplundhs, the very conservative billionaire family Dr. Oz married into and who funded his Senate campaign.  My wife could have died, I could have been a widower, and who knows if politics affected hospital policy causing a delay.

That's the dark side of all this "I support abortion in cases to save the life of the mother" bullshit.  It's gross, deceptive, and evil.  It isn't "we're ok with this to save your life".  It's "we have to rule out everything else until you are literally on the brink of death".  It should never get that far.

She’s what the GOP wanted, right? Married women having babies with their husbands?  But in an effort to control all women and their bodies, regardless of marital status, age, race, etc, women are dying by these draconian laws.

But the GOP doesn’t care. Women are disposable, fetuses only matter when they are in the womb…fuck them once they are out. And this is disproportionately going to kill women like Josseli and Amber Thurman, but I’m sure to republicans that’s a feature, not a bug.

This election literally means lives on the line.

Edit to add: I want to say fuck you to Paxton, Abbott, Cruz, Cornyn and all of red Texas.

Josseli and her family would have been just fine if you let the actual voters and money makers of Texas (those of us in San Antonio, Houston, Austin, etc) govern our cities as we see fit.

Comment: &gt;The fetus was on the verge of coming out, its head pressed against her dilated cervix; she was 17 weeks pregnant and a miscarriage was “in progress,” doctors noted in hospital records. At that point, they should have offered to speed up the delivery or empty her uterus to stave off a deadly infection, more than a dozen medical experts told ProPublica.

&gt;But when Barnica’s husband rushed to her side from his job on a construction site, she relayed what she said the medical team had told her: “They had to wait until there was no heartbeat,” he told ProPublica in Spanish. “It would be a crime to give her an abortion.”

&gt;For 40 hours, the anguished 28-year-old mother prayed for doctors to help her get home to her daughter; all the while, her uterus remained exposed to bacteria.

&gt;Three days after she delivered, Barnica died of an infection.

Comment: Joe will go down as a lion in history.

The guy is full of integrity, he is a great politician, he is insanely accomplished, one of the few Vice Presidents who actually did something ( usually VPs are not as active due to limited power), but Biden was working ten hours every day and getting Democrats and some Republicans to support Obama ), the guy worked so hard and achieved so much, but people don`t give him the respect he deserves.

Forward to Biden’s presidency so far, he’s the most productive and effective president by accomplishments in the last 40 years at least.

Biden was able to make deals with the most obstructionist opposition in modern US history ( if not ever, apart from the era around the civil war ),

And he didn`t just make any normal deals, he created the biggest and most extensive legislation packages in all of American history.

Roosevelt the previous record holder, managed to also do an insane amount of legislation but he had the full Democratic Party behind him and absolute support in Congress and the Senate. Biden did not and still managed to pull through, and that in a single term, Roosevelt had 4.

So Biden’s accomplishment is arguably more impressive.

Edit: To all the Gaza comments:

Bibi’s been a giant pain in the ass for the Biden administration this past year, and half the reason for him coming here was to help Trump get elected.

Then there is: 

- AIPAC: It is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America. With the Citizens United decision and increased foreign money, Israel can now have an almost direct impact on elections. Two pro-Palestinian Democratic incumbents in the U.S. House of Representatives lost in Democratic primaries because AIPAC made them the most expensive House primaries in history. This obviously sends a loud and clear message to other politicians.
	
- While Michigan has a large pro-Palestinian Muslim population, Pennsylvania—the biggest battleground state—has a sizable number of pro-Israeli Jewish Americans. Balancing between these two groups is crucial.
	
- Harris is going to base every single move from now until the election on very specific internal state-level polling and will be careful not to get ahead of it or try to shift where the electorate stands less than a month before the election.

- If Biden and Harris come out too strong against Netanyahu, they risk being labeled as anti-Semitic by the powerful right-wing media, AIPAC, and Russian disinformation campaigns. At the same time, if Biden cuts off aid to Israel, it wouldn’t be surprising if Netanyahu either stages a false flag operation or conveniently ignores intelligence of another terrorist attack just to say, “Look what Democrats did to us, making us defenseless”—a move that could guarantee a loss. After all, this is consistent with how Netanyahu thinks: the ends justify the means.

So, the best the Biden administration and Harris campaign can do is publicly toe the line while subtly signaling and “leaking” their extreme dissatisfaction with Netanyahu. Post-election, I’d bet that policy will change significantly.

Comment: Ignoring the humanitarian issues here.

Most people said they voted based on the economy.  Economists suggest that if Trump does in fact move forward with this plan, it will effect the economy negatively more than tariffs.

The theory is simple.  Many people with questionable status work in the food industry.  Processing meat and farming being two of the big ones.  If these people aren't there to do their jobs, then the work doesn't get done OR it gets done at a much higher cost.  So you'll see an immediate price increase on everything in the grocery store as a result.

Exactly what Trump voters didn't want, will absolutely happen under Trump.

This is like going back to an abusive ex when everyone told you that they haven't changed, that they are lying to you to get you back to punish you. Then the abused goes back to the ex and gets abused even worse because they offered their supremacy by leaving.

Trump has already threatened to not just fire Smith, but have him deported. Though deporting Smith would be hard, given that he’s a natural-born citizen, it’s still easy for Trump to get rid of all the cases against him.

They are careful, at least, to define a communist. For example, Kamala Harris is a communist, according to Trump. But I’m totally sure everyone will be fine and we have all been alarmist in saying people should be worried.

&gt; America PAC door knockers were flown to Michigan, driven in the back of a U-Haul, and told they’d have to pay hotel bills unless they met unrealistic quotas. One was surprised they were working to elect Donald Trump.

&gt; “I was in shock and disbelief,” says a paid door knocker flown to Michigan to help turn out the vote for former president Donald Trump on behalf of Elon Musk’s America PAC.

&gt;In Michigan, canvassers and paid door knockers for the former president, contracted by a firm associated with America PAC, have been subjected to poor working conditions: A number of them have been driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul van, according to video obtained by WIRED, and threatened that their lodging at a local motel wouldn’t be paid for if they didn’t meet canvassing quotas. One door knocker alleges that they didn’t even know they were signing up for anything having to do with Musk or Trump.

&gt;A representative for Musk and America PAC did not return a request for comment.


With this and all of his other shenanigans, it’s not surprising that Elon recently said about Trump, [“If he loses, I’m fucked.”](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/live-blog-posts/elon-musk-to-tucker-carlson-on-his-trump-support-if-he-loses-im-fed/)

“How long do you think my prison sentence is going to be?” he asked Carlson and the off-camera producers. “Will I see my children? I don’t know.”

Comment: Here is [his statement](https://x.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1851627802027758005). It's pretty long but here are a few excerpts that are worth reading:

&gt; I don’t really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians.

&gt; I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor. 

&gt; It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isn’t addicted to this crap, you probably understand.

&gt; I want to tune out.

&gt; But I can’t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. 

&gt; And I will always be an American before I am a Republican.

&gt; That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

&gt; But a candidate who won’t respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  - that won’t solve our problems.

&gt; It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.

&gt; We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won’t do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.

If you have time I'd give the whole thing a read!

Comment: &gt;  shining city on a hill,

That's something Reagan repeated throughout his time as president. We can judge him as a president how we choose. But his farewell address sums up the ideal that any president should strive for:

"And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one thing. The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs, I've thought a bit of the **"shining city upon a hill.''** The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he imagined. What he imagined was important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom man. He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat; and like the other Pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free."

"I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was ***a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.*** That's how I saw it, and see it still."

Comment: I'm a little on both sides here.  You're correct he's a symptom of a deeper sickness, but he is a unique threat.  His combination of personality defects have him as a truly unique cult of personality... he's relentless, shameless, and values nothing but his ego. Others will attempt to become the new Trump after he's gone, but it won't be so easy.  Watch enough interviews of all his minions and see, they have moments of humanity wher ethe veil falters, Trump never does... he never stops lying and coming.

Comment: Oh boy here it comes. I guess the internal polling indicates that they're going to lose, so they're switching over to stealing the election.

Steve Bannon (Trump's former political strategist) just got out of prison and he wasted absolutely zero time to start spewing insane conspiracy theories about the election. Seriously, the guy spoke for about 30 seconds before going into a conspiracy filled rant.

One would think that he would feel remorse for his actions after getting out of prison, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

Comment: &gt;“He’ll cut costs without anybody even knowing it—nobody’s going to notice—nobody is going to feel it,” Trump told Hannity, confirming that Musk does indeed plan to slash $2 trillion from the government’s budget.

&gt;Musk has proposed heading a “[Department of Government Efficiency](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/18/dogecoin-soars-15-as-elon-musk-replies-d-o-g-e-to-question-about-proposed-department-of-government-efficiency/)” under a Trump Cabinet—and the former president has clearly taken him up on it. At Trump’s hate-filled Madison Square Garden rally over the weekend, Musk announced that the target is $2 trillion in cuts.

&gt;Trimming the budget to the level would have to include cuts to essential government services like Medicare and Social Security—and could result in an initial huge economic crash. But Musk admitted Tuesday that that’s all a part of the plan, agreeing with a far-right troll on X that crashing the economy would lead to “sounder footing” in two years.

The federal government is on track to spend $6.5 trillion this year. Would you notice if suddenly your family lost a third of its budget?

More lies from the President of Promiscuity.

&gt;Krasner’s lawyers asked that the judge order enhanced security for the hearing, which was originally scheduled for Friday morning, noting that one X account had posted the prosecutor’s home address and wrote, “Krasner loves visitors. Mask up and leave all cellphones at home.”

&gt;Sanders joined CNN’s “State of the Union,” where he was asked by host Dana Bash about the blowback he received years ago after appearing on Rogan’s podcast and receiving his endorsement.

&gt;”Yeah, I think that’s fair enough. Look, you’re going to have an argument with Rogan, agree with him, disagree with him. But, what’s the problem with going on those shows? It’s hard for me to understand that,” Sanders said.

&gt;Sanders argued Sunday that more candidates need to be reaching the “millions and millions of viewers” that watch alternative media.

Comment: From the WXIA-TV article:

"Over 4 million ballots were cast during early voting, with more than half of Georgia’s 7.2 million registered voters already participating. An additional 1 million votes are expected by the time polls close, marking another significant turnout for the Peach State.

Raffensperger, speaking at a press conference, emphasized efforts to enhance voter security and speed in reporting. Raffensperger noted that voters have experienced short wait times, with average check-in times under a minute. 

"It’s been smooth sailing by and large," he said. “Average line time in Georgia right now is two minutes."

According to Senate Bill 189, which mandates reporting early and absentee ballots within one hour after polls close at 7 p.m., nearly all early votes should be in by 8 p.m., Raffensperger said. Smaller counties aim to finalize counts by 10:30 p.m., positioning Georgia to have a clearer election outcome than in past cycles."

Also the fact that Sheehy lied about getting shot in Afghanistan was such a massive gift for the Dems. These fucking idiots can’t get out of their own way. Not to mention that he shot himself accidentally at glacier national park.

Comment: I spent the lead up to the election trying to genuinely understand what the conservatives in my orbit saw in Trump and how they were arriving at their conclusion that he is best for America. Approaching this with curiosity and non-judgment, it became pretty clear to me that there were several things that were true to them and conclusions they were arriving at through what I perceived to be a convoluted kind of logic. 

1. *All politicians lie*. They believe fundamentally that all politicians are serial liars, including Trump (e.g., “you can’t take him literally”, “he’s never going to actually do that”). But here’s the rub: they can at least figure Trump out. It’s clear he’s a bullshitter, they know it, but he’s batting for their team. Harris, on the other hand, struck them as a true politician—one who will say whatever is necessary to win votes, regardless of the lie. Clinton was similar in their eyes, and yes, you can’t divorce the fact that they’re also women. 

2. *Trump is more authentic*. He “says it like it is” even if the “like it is” is complete, nonsensical bullshit. They know it, but again, at least they can parse it. Spend any time in rural America, and you’ll see bullshitting opinions is the great American pastime. And, they get that. The mental leap they make from here though is that this all actually makes Trump the more authentic candidate. Basically, “we don’t know exactly how Kamala is lying to us but we know she is” whereas the other guy is bullshitting us but we’re used to that kind of lying (look at how they excuse anything crazy Trump says with “he didn’t mean it that way” or “you’re taking him out of context”). Then wrap all this in overt and unconscious biases and you have a recipe for how to arrive at who is trustworthy. 

3. In this set of mental gymnastics, Trump is seen as the more trustworthy candidate, stemming from their perception of his authenticity. Yeah, they know he’s bullshitting them, but their intuition has led them to believe they understand Trump’s intent (e.g., Make America Great Again) so the semantics of whether or not he is actually being truthful about anything specific is of little concern. They trust him because he’s authentic, and they can’t (or don’t want to put in the effort to) parse where a candidate like Harris might be telling the truth versus lying. So, they dismiss it all and never look back. They’ve been spurned by politicians in the past so it’s just easier to go with the guy they see as authentic. 

Couple all this with the most massive disinformation campaign I’ve ever seen on X and other social media and you have the recipe for Trump getting elected. It all feels very logical to them, and they can’t understand why we don’t see it like they do. In their world, they have no clue why anyone would vote for Kamala Harris and why the left sees her as more trustworthy than Donald Trump (ergo, the left must just be batshit crazy!) They are two completely different heuristics, and the result of one of them has almost certainly set fire to American democracy. It’s the stuff of 1984 nightmares but here we are.

They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. F\*ck Hope.”"

Comment: The polls are basically saying "don't believe your eyes". 

Don't believe that Trump lost in 2020 and got less popular. 

Don't believe that JD Vance is one of the most historically unpopular people ever on any ticket.

Don't believe the mobilization of millions of women, immigrants, and LGBTQ voters who are being targeted.

Don't believe the unbridled enthusiasm since Harris accepted the nomination.

Don't believe the massive, packed stadiums and endorsement after endorsement for Harris coming from the staunchest conservative senator to the most liberal celebrities. 

Don't believe the massive spending advantage the Democratic party had.

Don't believe the washout Red Wave never happened and Trump aligned candidates have been getting battered for four years now. 

Don't believe the massive turnout that always favors Dems.

Basically, ignore everything you see and believe except these polls that are heavily weighted to give a desired outcome and haven't been right in any cycle over the past 8 years.

Comment: &gt;He also appeared increasingly concerned about the prospect of a Trump-led government.


&gt;'My mental health and the world can no longer peacefully coexist, and a lot of the reason is religion,' he said in July.


&gt;'I am terrified of religious zealots inflicting their misguided beliefs on me and my family. I have intrusive thoughts of being burned at the stake as a witch, or crucified on a burning cross.


&gt;'Having people actually believe that I or my child are Satan or, the anti-Christ or whatever their favorite color of boogie man they are afraid are this week.'


&gt;He had also accused Republicans of 'making it harder for women to leave' domestic violence relationships, writing 'Gilead here we come.' 


&gt;Gilead is an apparent reference to the Handmaid's Tale, a dystopian republic which overthew the United States and stripped away women's rights.

I wish we had more psychologists willing to tell people like this to get off of social media and stop watching cable news.

Millions of voters only want to hear that you will make their personal economy better. And that you call out some bad people you're going to stop.

After that, your policies don't matter to them (unless the policy ends up hurting them personally).

From now on it'll just be who can make the better broad sales pitch, and then come in and actually start legislating policy.

3. Women would carry Harris over the finish line.

Admittedly I was wrong about it all. Though I was right about Harris being a poor candidate and Biden putting the Dem party in a difficult position by refusing to drop out sooner. 

As always the Dem party will not learn from their mistakes.

However you can’t even be mad with the result because the democratic process worked as intended and Americans preferred Trump. Looks like he will win the popular vote too.

As a side note. Why can’t democrats be this aggressive? Fuck decorum, all it’s done is slap us in the face. Our voters are on fucking point with policy and organizing, our party leaders are weak and overly prideful. Most controlled opposition possible.

Meanwhile, republicans are steeped in fear. They capitulate to the biggest monster in their party and take out their embarrassment in the form of hate.

Comment: Actually these two things helped to undermine democracy in the USA! 

1) the Removal of the Fairness doctrine in 1987 which originally was a policy introduced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1949, aimed at ensuring that broadcasters presented contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. The doctrine required broadcasters to provide fair coverage of all sides of a public issue. It was officially abolished by the FCC in 1987.

2) Permitting corporate funding of political candidates, the landmark Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 significantly changed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. The Court ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment. This decision effectively allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, leading to the rise of Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I would add a third important decision by the Supreme Court helped to chip away at democracy and pave way to autocracy.  The Court declared that a President is immune from prosecution when exercising the ‘core powers’ of the presidency. The ambiguity or interpretation of core powers will be determined.

Oh America what have you done?

Comment: I don't understand how but he's going to win. I thought for sure enough people in this country wouldn't want someone like him again. He's only gotten worse and worse the last four years but he's surged this election and all this support, energy, and enthusiasm for Harris has translated to an absolute cathartic result.

I'm really not sure what to make of this. It's not that it wasn't always a close race but I don't get the wild margins Trump is winning by. Millions of votes in FL and TX and hundreds of thousands in other places, making up huge margin gains in New York. It's like Trump magically gained 10% of the population's vote despite the insurrection, the felonies, and everything else.

I had more faith in our country but history is doomed to repeat itself. This is going to be an election with ripple effects for a generation.

Edit: There was no magic 10%. Trump performed just as he did in 2020. It was the Democratic vote that didn't show up by the millions. That should be a wake up call that Democrats didn't have the pulse of the nation and Harris didn't have the support we were led to believe. Republicans were there in 2020 and they stayed there in 2024. Democrats disappeared in droves.

Comment: I’m tired of Democrats already throwing Kamala under the bus, as if she chose to be thrust into the nomination this way. As if the record donations, markers of blue enthusiasm being high (packed rallies, Dem enthusiasm to vote highest since 2008), and the polls showing an extremely close race were nothing. 

She lost because the mood of the country shifted in a way that was not captured by the earlier polls, which turned out to be horribly wrong. Therefore the campaign’s messaging, which she executed beautifully, turned out to be ineffective.

To achieve anything, we have to build a broad coalition of working class people. Systemic racism and sexism are huge problems, but I think often identity politics is a tool of the capitalist class to divide the working class. I think building a broad coalition is going to take talking to people we disagree with in very different ways than we have been.

It doesn’t get much worse than that for the Palestinians. 

To the people who’ve been arguing with me for a week about how Biden/Harris are the same as (or worse than) Trump on Israel-Palestine and believe things can’t get any worse, *this is the fucking “worse” we were talking about*.

You’ve *fucked* the Palestinians over big time.

…but it’s not your fault, right? Because you didn’t vote. You didn’t pick the “lesser of two evils.” Your conscience is clean. Good for you! Keep telling yourselves this as the news rolls in from Gaza after Trump takes office and Mike Fucking *Huckabee*—evangelical Christian who hates Muslims and believes all Jewish people must return to Israel to bring about the second coming of Jesus—gives Netanyahu the actual green light you claimed Biden gave him.

Elections have consequences, and you’re about to get a lesson on that from the worst people possible. Thanks for nothing.

Comment: I want to share a story about Jon Tester, and part of the reason I've voted for him for over a decade.

When I got out of the Marines, I went to UM on the GI Bill.

The money didn't come for tuition/stipends etc. I was a young former E-4, newly married. We were barely covering expenses and borrowing money from family. I considered dropping out.

As late October approached, I was getting desperate. My wife was pregnant and we were scraping by. The VA was not helpful at all. I'd wait for 3-4 hours on hold just to be dropped or be told their hands were tied. The campus VA was sympathetic but couldn't do anything, either.

I ended up emailing all my local/state representatives and Senators.  One of them, the only one to respond, forwarded the message to Tester's office.

One day later, I was in Tester's Missoula office with *his chief of staff* in the closing days of an election year.

She took down all my info, thanked me for my service, and Tester had a congressional inquiry filed that afternoon.

That was a Friday--I had my money on Monday. 


This is just an anecdote, and it seems small, but this guy's team sat down with a random 22 year old kid in the heat of an election and solved my issue with compassion and quick action. Right through all the red tape.

I'll never forget that of all the people I asked for help, it was a local Democrat and Senator Tester's office *alone* who reached out and helped me.

In my opinion she is way more likeable and relatable. 
Didn't act entitled.

Didn't say or do anything singularly destructive to the movement. 

I'm just not sure I understand our countries values anymore. I liked her way more than Biden or Clinton. And everyone I spoke to seemed way more enthusiastic about her as well. 

Yet somehow, the cruel person who called the other side varmen, is a convicted felon, twice impeached, regularly says intentionally hurtful things, is more popular...

Truly an odd paradigm shift in American politics. 
And he shows no intention on fighting for any values I have... So IDK how I fit in his America. He doesn't make me feel like he will be a president for anyone other than his rich friends and those he's convinced are just people that will be rich someday too.

It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.”

We actually had the exact same thing happening over here in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016. [Here is an article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-anger-bregret-leave-voters-protest-vote-thought-uk-stay-in-eu-remain-win-a7102516.html) from June 25th, 2016, one day after the Brexit vote:

&gt;Electoral services workers have reported calls from people **asking if they could change their decision** after Friday’s result became clear [...] Mandy Suthi, a student who voted to leave, told ITV News she would tick the Remain box if she had a second chance and said her parents and siblings also regretted their choice. “**I would go back to the polling station and vote to stay, simply because this morning the reality is kicking in**,” she said. “I wish we had the opportunity to vote again,” she added, saying she was “very disappointed”.

&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Education, 54% of U.S. adults 16-74 years old - about 130 million people - lack proficiency in literacy, reading below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level. That’s a shocking number for several reasons, and its dollars and cents implications are enormous because literacy is correlated with several important outcomes such as personal income, employment levels, health, and overall economic growth.

Wild to think so many people read below a grade 6 level.

The best part is the fact that he doesn't have to worry about a reelection. He has a free pass to do _whatever the hell he wants without having to worry about the consequences_

Have him and his cronies cut funding to Ukraine and send it to Russia? The people would hate it, but what would he care, he doesn't have another election to worry about.

Destroy the economy? Why would he care. He's not getting elected again. He can destroy the economy and give a middle finger to the American people and say "Deal with it"

He has a free pass now and we, the people, are going to suffer.

When Rogan was still under that impression, he tore into Biden, demanding that he immediately resign and claiming that he would be fired if he had ever said something so stupid.

Rogan's errand boy quickly came in to inform him that Biden was actually referencing a Donald Trump quote.  When confronted with the truth, Joe all of a sudden didn't think the idiotic quote was a big deal, Trump's mental capacity need not be questioned, and we just need to move onto a different topic.

Comment: &gt;To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word—doublethink—involved the use of doublethink.

A day after surviving a legal challenge in Pennsylvania, Musk’s daily sweepstakes was hit Tuesday with fresh claims in federal courts in Texas and Michigan.

Jacqueline McAferty of Arizona alleged she never would have signed the America PAC petition and handed over personal identifying information if she knew the winners weren’t picked at random and she had no chance of taking home $1 million. In reality, the winners weren’t picked at random, but were carefully selected to be spokespeople for the pro-Donald Trump political action committee."

Comment: “We got beat because the conservatives and Republicans built a different media system,” Jones said on the channel Thursday. “It had to do with online, had to do with podcasts, with streaming platforms. And they were spending their money there.”

Jones bemoaned that many Democrats and mainstream media outlets were “laughing at Trump for throwing away his ground game and doing weird stuff online.”

“It turned out we were the idiots,” he continued. “We woke up in a body bag because while we were knocking on doors, they were making these phones into 24-hour-a-day political weapons for themselves.”

Trump won handily Tuesday, sweeping the seven swing states after weeks of spurning interviews with mainstream media outlets. He opted instead for appearances on popular podcasts and internet programs — including Joe Rogan’s and other shows with audiences predominantly made up of young men, a voting bloc the GOP candidate aggressively courted.

Comment: That’s because the media refused to aggressively critique Trump’s bullshit this election. He stood and promised to lower grocery and gas prices, and remove immigrants, and the media took it at face value while critiquing Harris for *checks notes* “not explaining her policies.”

Then he won and suddenly the media is telling you your low gas prices will be caused by your president beginning a consumer-funded trade war that will end in a recession or depression. Your gas will be $1 because no one gives a fuck about gas when you have no job, no house, no retirement and no money after your president destroyed the economy. 

Your imports will be taxed at 50-200% and everything you buy will have a 50-200% price increase added on. What did you all think was going to happen? Companies in other countries were going to cut their losses and pay it for you? Naive, but who can blame you when the media spent three months discussing how Harris “doesn’t do enough interviews,” instead of telling you how tariffs work. 

And you believe your groceries will go down? 17% of illegal immigrants are farmers and 40% of farmers are illegal immigrants. Can you name one industry that survives when 40% of its blue collar, boots on the ground workers disappear? No. Enjoy your $18 eggs and your $30 ears of corn. Maybe you would know all of this if the media didn’t spend three months reporting on “how Harris responded to Joe Biden calling Trump voters garbage,” and “did Trump fart at rally?”

But you know, it’s too late, and the media knew that. They knew all of this. None of it is new, they just didn’t want to miss out on four years of clicks.

Granted, local elections and ballot measures are hugely important, and are why you should vote even if you're in those states, but it's already hard enough to get people to vote for President, so good luck with getting people to care about local politics.

&gt;In the end, a majority of American voters chose Trump because they wanted what he was selling: a nonstop reality show of rage and resentment.... Trump voters never cared about policies, and he rarely gave them any. (Choosing to be eaten by a shark rather than electrocuted might be a personal preference, but it’s not a policy.)

Comment: &gt; During the first three weeks of October, Donald Trump staged a remarkable comeback, rebounding from a huge deficit to a commanding lead. 

I'm sorry, the "data" showing a consistently tight race was a "commanding lead?"

&gt; Trump moved relentlessly upwards in the electoral vote count, as forecast by the Miller framework

Ahh, ok, so you're basing this off of, from what I can tell, is an economic theory?

Here's some more slant from the article:

&gt; The Biden administration’s policy of sending arms to Israel for bolstering its forces in the war versus Iran, and to Ukraine for fortifying its campaign to defeat the the Russian invasion is deeply troubling to a large swath of the electorate—especially since it’s unclear how long those conflicts, and hence our involvement, will last.

Alright, let's make things clear. Joe Biden has been stuck between a rock and a hard place ever since he came into office, so make no mistake here, if the U.S. refused to send aid to its allies, Biden would undoubtedly be facing even harsher criticism.

Putin's invasion of Ukraine was all but inevitable, and the conflict in Israel has been going on for over a century, ever since the signing of the Balfour declaration after WW1.

Joe Biden did not start these wars, full stop, in fact, judging by Trump's mutually beneficial relationship with Putin and his disastrous foreign policy endeavors, it's probable that Trump helped accelerate Putin's autocratic and unjustified invasion. Oh, I'm sorry, "special military occupation," err, I mean "operation."

What's more, Trump's "middle east peace deal" was anything but. It was a poorly contrived, amateurish political stunt that happened to coincide with his reelection campaign. It was laughably brief, he didn't even conceive of it himself and he failed to get the appropriate signatures and concessions.

This combined with his capitulation to far right Israeli leaders only heightened tensions in the region. His evidently ineffectual "Abraham Accords," his controversial recognition of the annexation of The Golan Heights, and his contentious order to relocate the U.S embassy in Israel, weakened our position as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians while escalating tensions there.

What's more, Trump was seen as such a dangerous interventionist that Congress passed not one, but TWO historic war powers resolutions.

Let's not forget that Trump withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in more provocations in the region and Iran upscaling its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it would’ve taken Iran at least a year.

During the Trump administration, the U.S. was also engaged in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and more than 60 American soldiers died in hostile action.

And despite criticisms from Republicans, it was Trump who literally negotiated with terrorists and ordered direct talks with the Taliban without consulting with our allies and partners or allowing the Afghan government at the negotiating table

Trump patronized the Taliban by publicly considering inviting them to Camp David on the anniversary of 9/11.

As part of the withdrawal deal, Trump also pressured the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison, including senior war commanders, without securing the release of the only American hostage known to be held by the Taliban.

During the transition from Trump to Biden, the outgoing Administration provided no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies.

And don't get me started on Trump's efforts to align himself with Putin and the Kremlin agenda, while emboldening Putin and his greatest goal of weakening NATO. Senior administration officials revealed that multiple times during his presidency, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from NATO. And don't forget that Trump was impeached for withholding Javelin missiles from Ukraine in 2019. There aren't enough characters in a reddit post to cover it all. But I'd be happy to lay it all out for those who think otherwise.

If only these low propensity voters deciding the outcome of our elections were actually informed of Trump's disastrous presidency, there would have never been a "commanding lead" in the first place.

I know the left likes to point out that the economy looks decent on paper, but when everyday Americans feel that groceries and utility bills are too expensive, you can’t really polish that turd no matter how much you try.

Love him or hate him, Donald Trump has a genuine personality where he’s not afraid to tell you what he thinks, and that resonates with many Americans. Kamala Harris played it too safely by avoiding the media, and when she did talk to the media, her answers were confusing and evasive. No one likes being given the “run around,” and that’s what Harris did.

I think people genuinely didn’t like Harris. Her interviews on YouTube have thousands of comments absolutely trashing her, she was being heckled at her rallies, etc. She just came across as fake.

This isn't any old appointment, this signals radical, horrible changes.  Why do I know this?  Because this is an actual nightmare appointment for me...like I was actually scared Oz/Aspludhs would get a major administration spot affecting health care.

The #1 hospital under the Asplundh family thumb is Abington Hospital, part of the Jefferson Health system in the Philadelphia area.  The Asplundhs have affected hospital policy with conservative politics in a way that nearly killed my wife with the mismanagement of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and the complete avoidance of performing an abortion until they created a life-of-the-mother situation through inaction.

I can only imagine what this means for Medicare, low-income family and immigrant health.  I'm horrified what Oz, as an Asplundh proxy can do to this country in this regard and as a voice for other changes that might not be his job but are related to women's health.

 I’m ready to accept that there was no fraud. I don’t wanna be hanging onto “they stole the election!” For 4 years like our idiot fellow citizens on the right. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump’s accusations of cheating was just projection.

 One thing that would be pretty worrisome is that if there was actual fraud, and Trump’s victory was found to actually be illegitimate, we will have to deal with the backlash from Trumpers.

Comment: Headline is very misleading IMO. Here's the relevant direct quote from AOC:

&gt;*It’s interesting that we are in a cultural moment where, on the left and the right and the center, there’s just a certain cache and reward to being an a--hole. And yeah, we’ve seen it on the right — we also see it on the left. And I actually think that we need to be paying more attention to how a person is, because a lot of people use righteous or popular causes as an excuse or a smokescreen to let out their worst impulses or the ways that they wish they could treat people. And I think we need to pay a lot more attention to that in terms of deciding how to trust and who to trust as we move forward. I think it’s a really big deal.*

To my reading, she's saying that there are examples of people of all political alignments who use controversy to treat people poorly. The headline makes it sound like she denounced everyone who's angry online, which is just not true.

Comment: I can relate to this part:

&gt;In an op-ed for CNN, journalist Richard L. Eldredge wrote about his own familial fracture, saying it wasn’t about political affiliations, but about the very fabric of his loved one’s being. “To be clear, this was never about a difference of political opinion,” he [wrote](https://cnn.com/2020/11/10/opinions/trump-tore-my-family-apart-eldredge/index.html). “We’ve gotten through that before. This was about a fundamental difference in morality, integrity and decency and a person who exemplifies none of those things.”

&gt;That’s the thing Holly struggles with. She tries to reason through her mother’s beliefs – she’s a business owner who was raised in a rural red state and still lives there. When Holly and her mother discuss Trump, Holly’s mother says she knows he “isn’t a good person” but she agrees with his business policies. Holly tries to understand, but she just doesn’t get it – how can the purported business policies be more important than what happened on [January 6th](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/january-6-insurrection-families), or what Holly views as the problematic rhetoric against marginalized people? It’s painful, Holly says, to know they believe such different things about the world. 

This is what I'm struggling with as well. I've always believed in the importance of empathy and of trying to see things from other people's perspectives, but I've tried to do that with the people in my family (both immediate and extended) who are Trump supporters and I still don't understand. And these family members aren't cultists or Qanon or anything like that. They're not buying MAGA hats. They know Trump is a terrible person and they wish he had a different personality. Yet they voted for him anyway. They gave him a free pass on every awful thing he's done. They rewarded him by giving him the most powerful position in America. They looked at everything Trump has done and they accepted it, and they instead found Harris to be the unacceptable one. It blows my mind.

As the quote above says, there's a fundamental difference in the way Trump supporters and non Trump supporters see the world. This isn't just politics. It's deeper than that. So I feel an odd sense of distance and separation from Trump supporters -- even ones in my family, even ones I live with.

I feel sad about this. I want people who support different candidates to get along. I don't want all this division. But even though I don't want things to be this way, this is how it is. And I'm not sure how it can change.

EDIT: I want to say a big thank you to everyone who upvoted and awarded this post. I feel really sad about all this division and family and friends distancing themselves from each other. I appreciate all of you who can relate to how I feel. I hope and pray our country can find some way to heal from this.

Comment: I completely relate to this post, esp this:  They gave him a free pass on every awful thing he's done. They rewarded him by giving him the most powerful position in America. They looked at everything Trump has done and they accepted it, and they instead found Harris to be the unacceptable one. It blows my mind.

We can disagree over politics, but MAGA isn’t politics, it’s ignorance and hate wrapped in the American flag.  I’m not having any part of it.  

To the young ones who’re stuck with MAGA parents, don’t try to change them or use logic to help them out.  It’s not logical thinking on their part.  Their amygdala are fried and they’re in a never ending fear filled fever pitch.  Take care of yourselves, build your own friend and family groups.   Nourish those who nourish you.  

It’s okay to write others off.  We don’t get to choose our parents.  We do get to choose how much interaction we continue to have with them if they’re not good people.

This country - and clearly its media, judging from these headlines - is deep in denial. We didn't elect the questionable, deeply problematic outsider of Trump 2016.


We elected a convicted felon who repeatedly promised to dismantle the rule of law to protect himself from prison. We've given him control of all three branches of government as he plots to remove or imprison the generals who might defy him when he unleashes the military domestically against 'illegals' and, quite likely, his foes.


This is a man running a knife through our country's guts, at our own request, and the media is clutching pearls about norms. If there's a story here, it's that Trump no longer has a reason to follow *any* law or norm - and fucking transition paperwork is near the least of our worries.

&gt;Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before.

&gt;...

&gt;Now on Crain’s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care.

&gt;By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain’s blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were “blue and dusky.” Her organs began failing.

&gt;Hours later, she was dead.

Comment: The procedures used to perform an elective abortion are the same procedures used to protect the life and fertility of a woman when a pregnancy starts to go sideways.

Any legislation that criminalizes abortion, even if it allows use to protect the heath of the mother, opens the possibility of criminal prosecution and would require the defendant to produce an affirmative defense. Because of this, it makes doctors and hospitals less willing to perform such procedures.

Criminalizing abortion was a bad idea. These are the costs that we will pay until we reverse this horrible and ignorant decision. You cannot stop elective abortions without this happening.

Comment: I’m not sure if you’ve read or heard about the book Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin, but it’s basically a political playbook written in the 90s of what and how Russia should do in all parts of the world in order to gain power. Here’s a synopsis for the West - Americas:

Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke “Afro-American racists” to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should “introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.

Dugin is a far right political philosopher in Russia and apparently Putin utilizes a lot of what is in that book.

Edit: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics

Link for anyone interested in reading about the book and its contents.

Edit 2: Thank you for the awards. I believe this should be more widespread and not looked at as a crazy conspiracy theory. There are concepts written in there that have been, and are actively, being used around the globe. If it isn’t farfetched to believe genders are being changed in schools, people are eating others pets, etc, this shouldn’t be any less believable. Good luck to us all.

I would probably never stop laughing if I were them. This is the most shameful fucking thing to ever happen to this country in the modern era.

**EDIT**: I want to just clarify, and ammend my language here. When I say "enemy," what I mean is they are considered our geopolitical opposition. 

What that means is, China's goals, like taking over Taiwan, are antithetical or in conflict with America's goals, which is preventing Taiwan from being annexed. 

We are talking general policy. It doesn't mean we will inevitably end up in conflict with them. This is what diplomacy is for - continually negotiating policy agendas for nations in ways that don't lead to conflict or harm or loss of life.

I make this change because I got a fairly low effort comment:

&gt; China my enemy lol while everything you wear a d buy is Chinese hahahhahaha get a life

Now, it's simply a matter of fact that both the US and China consider themselves in opposition to one another on many issues. They are considered a geopolitical rival to the US. 

But this doesn't mean "china is my enemy." I do not think like that, and my wording was wrong. They're a nation, like any other, with billions of people with hopes and dreams. 

As fucked up as the world is right now, we don't need more nationalist thinking.

CLARK COUNTY, Indiana — Southern Indiana election officials have repeated a well-publicized blunder from the 2022 general election. 

Over 4,000 ballots from three precincts in Clark County were not included in the county's first batch of unofficial election results posted Wednesday morning.

Republican County Clerk Ryan Lynch said the issue was with "memory sticks" used to transfer election results from voting machines into their central computing system.

&gt;Conversations with Republican voters and speeches at the RNC made it clear that their idea of "unity" is conformity. That the obstacle to "unity" was all these liberated women and queer people and minorities and academics and artists who keep insisting on being different than what MAGA wants everyone to be. Implicit in many discussions about "unity" was a hope that all those liberals would shut up, bend the knee, go back into the closet, or whatever else it takes to hide or eradicate difference.

Comment: I saw a quote from some 45-year-old Trump voter from Pennsylvannia that said that he thought Trump was "kind of Hitler-like" but that "people weren't doing so well and the economy needs help." 

Which is the same fucking way Hitler took power in the first place - blaming a marginalized group for economic conditions and promising to fix all of it.

The most significant part of Trump’s election ramifications hasn’t had nearly as much attention as it warrants.

The open nature of social media in non-authoritarian states enables foreign governments to inject opinion and propaganda en-masse to whichever group or sector they choose. This is achieved by impersonating membership of that same group and astroturfing communities in a procedural and calculated manner using thousands of coordinated accounts.

Trump’s blatant indicators of compromise from the Russian government, in combination with this policy, results in a digital ecosystem without checks or measures toward preventing this interference from occurring again and again. The social media platforms that were leveraged to enable these coordinated efforts of manipulation to take place unrestricted, will, in combination with the lack of any democratic government entity that may have contributed toward the hindrance of this occurring, will have zero ability to prevent this mass interference on the world population from occurring going forward. This will serve to further cement the narrative on any political party or movement those same state entities choose to inject influence over via these online platforms for the foreseeable future.

There is massive precedent for a quid pro quo in this situation between the party benefiting solely from having the narrative crafted in their favour to influence the population deciding an election en-masse to get them elected; and the benefit to the state entity carrying out the mass interference on that same parties behalf. 

With the guardrails removed and no ability for this to be combatted going forward, the flow of propaganda to an even greater extent and severity than anyone can comprehend, and the manipulation of every online discussion going forward, is inevitable. 

The ignorance of the general population when it comes to their self-perceived ability to know when they are in contact with propaganda, in combination with a tsunami of unfettered manipulation delivered direct, means this may be the most danger democracy worldwide has ever faced. 

Your family, friends, colleagues, representatives are all exposed and vulnerable to this messaging. It results in a situation where they find themselves in the crosshairs of the policies of the party they are voting for. Simply due to their focus being on the hate, division and populist soundbites packaged alongside, instead of the policies themselves.

Democratic governments worldwide need recognise this as the end game, and take action to regulate the ability for these platforms to be leveraged, or they will quickly lose their ability to choose to do so.

Comment: When my wife was pregnant the first time, we were vacationing in Montana and she miscarried at glacier national park. It was a terrible experience driving 90 miles to a hospital for “care”. The only thing I could think of was what are the abortion laws in Montana? Am I going to have to drive back to Minnesota so we can get the care we need if this miscarriage doesn’t go right? The PA that was the “doctor” in the ER didn’t seem to understand my question when I asked him what the abortion laws are in Montana. (This being a year after the fall of Roe) That was the scary part for me is knowing that some medical professionals hadn’t even begun to think about what the over throw of Roe could mean for them. 

Fast forward to her second pregnancy, my parents winter in Texas from Minnesota and we generally go down during Christmas time to spend 2 weeks with them. We kindly made it known that we would not be joining them as we will not be traveling to states that treat my wife as a second class citizen. 

I can’t imagine the feeling of hopelessness these women feel going to the hospital for help only to be turned away because you or the baby aren’t dead enough. So please any men that read this, please vote for your wife, daughters and any other female you are about. It could literally save their life.

Comment: &gt;Kirk seemed genuinely upset that women could be voting for Harris in massive numbers — and lying to their controlling husbands about it.

&gt;“It is so repulsive. It is so disastrous. It is the embodiment of the downfall of the American family. I think it’s so gross. I think it’s just so nauseating,” Kirk said, set off by a new ad, produced by a liberal Christian organization, that features Julia Roberts reminding women that how one votes need not be shared.

The downfall of the American family is caused by a loss of absolute control over and ability to invade the privacy of women.

That’s what *he* considers to be disastrous and repulsive. That’s not what **we** consider to be those things. That’s not who we are. Vote.

EDIT: I've mentioned it elsewhere, but I'll clarify here too. He's describing a firing squad as a thinly veiled allegory to war. He's fantasizing. He's right that she's a "chickenhawk", but my criticism is with his _rhetoric_ of basically describing Cheney in a firing squad execution given that _rhetoric_ is what conservatives blame Democrats for Trump's assassination attempts.

&gt; In response to the backlash to the comments, Trump's campaign said the former president was criticizing Cheney's willingness to send American troops into combat while not having served in the military herself

Comment: &gt;Epstein also shared photos from the “late 90s” of Trump surrounded by “topless young women” at Epstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida, where the disgraced financier victimized dozens of underage girls alongside his friend Ghislaine Maxwell.

&gt;“And in some of the pictures, they’re sitting in his lap,” Wolff said. “I mean, and, and then there’s one I especially remember where there’s a stain, a telltale stain and on the front of Trump’s pants, and the girls are pointing at him and laughing.”

&gt;Wolff claimed the FBI discovered the photos in Epstein’s safe when the agency raided his home in 2019, but never released the images to the public. Wolff described the photographs when discussing how he used Epstein as a main source for his book Fire and Fury, which focused on the Trump White House.

&gt;Wolff said that Epstein was afraid of Trump, believing that he was “capable of doing anything.”

So Trump's FBI had evidence of Trump during Trump's term in office and it never got released? At the very least, trim must've known they had this. Then Epstein decided to kill himself?

Comment: (In response to a Julia Roberts ad reminding women they can make their own decisions, and that votes aren't public)

&gt;This outraged some supporters of Donald Trump in the right-wing media. Fox News host Jesse Watters declared that such an act by his wife would be “the same thing as having an affair.” Charlie Kirk, whose organization is working to turn out Trump voters, offered some additional context to the scenario offered in the ad.

&gt;The woman sporting a hat with an American flag, Kirk said, is “coming in with her sweet husband, who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go and have a nice life and provides for the family, and she lies to him saying I’m going to vote for Trump, then she votes for Kamala Harris as her little secret in the voting booth.”

Gee, what could possibly be the reason women are defiant and afraid of their husbands in conservative culture? Such a mystery.

Comment: I particularly like this part of the article:

&gt;“These people are dishonest,” Gingrich responded. “And so, for them to tell people to lie is just one further example of the depth of their corruption. I mean, how do you run a country where you’re walking around saying, ‘Wives should lie to their husbands, husbands should lie to their wives’?”
&gt;
&gt;Gingrich, who cheated on his second wife, then held Democrats responsible for America's moral degeneration.

*Chef's kiss.* Then the article continues with this beautiful line:

&gt;“I mean, what kind of a totally amoral, corrupt, sick system have the Democrats developed? If you think about it at that level, it is astonishing, the decay," he said, before claiming that the "decay" is why Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who reportedly maintained at least three romantic liaisons outside of his marriage with Cheryl Hines, left the Democratic Party and endorsed former President Donald Trump.

I'll repeat what I said further down: There have been zero concessions to get the Cheneys' endorsements. Harris can't control who endorses her, but she can utilize her based on internal polling to capture the last remaining batch of undecided voters in the electorate: conservative-leaning Never Trumpers. Everyone on the left is already well aware of the existential threat that Trump is. The fact that you have Bernie Sanders and AOC under the same banner as Cheney temporarily in order to defeat Trump speaks to the danger of Trump more than anything else.

You don't need MAGA. You need Never Trumpers to vote Harris instead of sitting out. That's the benefit of Liz Cheney, and it is having an effect. Proven by how much Trump is attacking her.

Comment: Prefacing this by saying I am not defending his stance, but simply want to explain it. Bush has consistently, even before Trump, said he did not think it was appropriate for former presidents to weigh in on current administrations and politics. He has tried to live up to that. First, by not criticizing the Obama administration and then not criticizing the Trump or Biden administrations. He seems committed to remaining completely neutral in that regard. You can disagree with that stance (I do), but he’s at least being consistent in his desire to avoid publicly weighing in on current politics.

I think the takeaway for the democrats is you need headline worthy slogans that make the most basic statement about how you will improve the chequebook around the dinner table. No "economy is great for corporations", just "we are going to maximize household wealth". Save the platform and anything complex for when you're asked how.


Trump just lied and said he'd give everything to everyone that they want and despite the low probability of doing even a fraction, or the high probability of doing the opposite, people walk away going "he knows how I'm hurting and he said he will stop it". Apparently fantasyland is where votes are won and lost.

Comment: I posted this in another thread yesterday but similar to what you’re saying:

There’s something interesting to look at. Let’s look at a sampling of major swing states that also have Senate elections this year: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Trump is projected to win ALL of these yet for four out of five the Democrat is projected to win the Senate election at the same time, and the fifth it’s neck and neck with the Republican barely ahead while Trump is way ahead.

I know people don’t always vote for the same party for president and senator, but they usually do. Here’s the current voting numbers to compare and see the disparity:

Arizona

D: Senator-1,360,000 vs Harris-1,310,000 (-50,000)

R: Senator-1,353,000 vs Trump-1,492,000 (+139,000)

Nevada

D: Senator-675,000 vs Harris-678,000 (+3,000)

R: Senator-654,000 vs Trump-724,000 (+70,000)

Wisconsin

D: Senator-1,672,000 vs Harris-1,667,000 (-5,000)

R: Senator-1,643,000 vs Trump-1,697,000 (+54,000)

Michigan

D: Senator-2,708,000 vs Harris-2,724,000 (+16,000)

R: Senator-2,687,000 vs Trump-2,804,000 (+117,000)

Pennsylvania

D: Senator-3,327,000 vs Harris-3,364,000 (+37,000)

R: Senator-3,369,000 vs Trump-3,510,000 (+141,000)

For historical comparison, in 2020 there were NO states that voted for one party for president and another party for Senate (the only arguable one being Maine that gave electoral votes to both parties for president so whoever they voted into the Senate would contradict part of the state regardless).

As well, in 2016, there were absolutely ZERO states that voted one party for president and another for Senate.

Comment: Zero states split tickets for Senate and Presidency in 2016 and 2020? But 4 or 5 and counting split tickets in 2024? Wow.

In his bio of LBJ, Robert Caro documents the type of fraudulent ballot stuffing and vote buying that occurred in Texas during the early part of the 20th century. It’s important to note because election fraud is a real thing that has happened. 

I don’t want to come across as conspiratorial, but what strikes me as interesting about Caro’s history relevant to the above is that the ballot engineering went hand in hand with the vote counting. It was important, in part to disguise the fraud, that you only tipped the scales ever so slightly—only in the counties you needed it, only in counties where it could be explained, and only by margins that could be rationalized.

I’m not saying this election was rigged. I am saying that if the election were rigged, if someone had the means to buy votes or stuff the ballots or otherwise manipulate the count, isn’t the data you shared kinda what we’d expect to see?

Did this only happen in swing states? Did any other (non swing) states also split? Or did Trump only get these perfectly sized bumps exactly where he needed them most?

Edit: …Because if Trump’s surge can be explained by under voting then you’d expect to see under voting nationwide, wouldn’t you?

Edit 2: Yes. Yes. 

The question is not:

How is it possible that a Presidential candidate could receive more votes than a Senator?

The question is:

Why is it happening at historically unprecedented rates in the swing states and is it happening at historically unprecedented rates *only* in the swing states?

Comment: Anecdotally this tracks. Democratic canvassers who’ve been by my house are polite, engaged, and want to discuss the election. And if I say I don’t want to talk about it, they wish me well and leave.

The one conservative canvasser was a guy on a bike. He asked if I’d already voted, asked if I wanted literature on the candidate, entered something into an app on his phone and fucked off. Absolutely no enthusiasm for the guy he’s supposed to be representing whatever.

~~That’s the problem with paid canvassers vs volunteer ones. The paid ones don’t give a shit about the candidate they’re representing and it shows.~~

EDIT: I’ve been corrected. The amount of canvassing required for a successful campaign is far too much for volunteers to handle alone. Paying active and engaged canvassers is necessary as it allows them to canvas full time.

So I’ll amend my initial statement to say that in my own very limited and local experience this election, the Democrats are running a solid ground game with quality canvassers, whether they are paid or volunteer. While the only Republican that showed up at my door didn’t seem to care at all. Which mirrors larger stories, like the OP, about the dysfunctional operation Leon is running.

Comment: A month before the election, Wisconsin purged my voter registration. I’ve been voting since 2005, but they sent me a long list of steps to re-register. 

Busy with my small business, I decided to just bring my ID and mail with my address day of. 

I waited almost 2 hours in the cold, windy November weather with my wife—when we finally got inside the building, six elderly volunteers with iPads were managing the entire process. Even with only 25 people ahead, it took another 1.5 hours to get to the front. There were 10 voting desks, but never more than 3 were in use at one time. 

300+ people behind us now waiting in a damn near thunderstorm/rain and growing. 

People were irate, I was irate. They were being strict on ID and residency proof, turning away people and making it difficult for the rest of us. 

Something felt really off and still feels really off, and everyone in that voting line felt the same as we were all bitching to one another, like seriously everybody. 

How the fuck is it not voter suppression to make people wait that long to vote and then make the process so complicated? I have been dreaming about voting this entire year and think about politics way too much and I was ready to get the fuck out of line with how unnecessarily grueling it was. I knew I wouldn’t forgive myself so I stayed but damn…

And my vote—and my wife’s—still hasn’t been counted.

Comment: Yeah. I suspect the same (a lawsuit in PA). 

My friend voted by mail, as she is an expat in Mexico. She did happen to be home for the election due to a death in the family. Her ballot was received but challenged because she “isn’t registered,” and we looked, her registration isn’t showing up when you search her. She voted in every election since she turned 18 in the 80s. 

The ACLU said there was a voter purge just before the election. My mom, who’s a poll worker, said she did more provisional ballots than she ever did before. Anecdotal, but telling. 

The challenge against my friend was withdrawn. But that doesn’t change her registration being purged. The aclu is on it but it’s insane. I highly suspect a lawsuit. And honestly, if the election was “stolen” through voter suppression, it would be kind of brilliant to do it after creating so much chaos and doubt with the last election. 

What happened with January 6 and the conspiracy theories makes it an even bigger uphill battle to talk about voter suppression, gerrymandering, voter roll purges, etc that can have an impact. 

And what’s crazier too is that people were removed, but the lawsuit asking to remove them was thrown out by the judge. Not to mention, my friend never should have been on an inactive list in the first place as she’s been an active voter for over 30 years. The whole thing is insane and I wonder how many “errors” like this happened, particularly if the ACLU says they’re fielding calls left and right.

Rogan said Elon musk knew the results 4 hours before the media orgs with some app he has. Ivanka has patents for voting machines, musk has access to lots of resources and cyber infrastructure. Trump has been repeatedly telling his base he doesn't even need their votes.

Look, I don't want to be some manic conspiracy theorist here, but do you all really think the career criminal who has vehemently cried the election in 2020 was rigged and unfair and fraudulent didn't try to maliciously tip the election is his favor this time around?

I've also seen countless people on social media and in my personal circle say they checked on their ballots and they were "received but not counted" (I know this is anecdotal, but still)

Something fucky is going on here, I just really hope the FBI/DOD/secret service/ whoever is on top of it.

Edited to add: some voting machines were hooked up to starlink to "improve connectivity", at the very least that is a huge conflict of interest.

Comment: Unless someone becomes a cop after having started a different career, they are recruited at age 17-18 straight out of high school. From there they go to police academy for 6 months, and then they're cops for the rest of their lives. They have literally no life experience whatsoever outside of their cop lives. It recently came up when in Los Angeles the cops raided a medical imaging facility because they were tipped off by the utility provider that there was above-normal electrical usage. The cops thought it was an illegal growing operation, ignored signs regarding magnets and metals, entered the MRI room with an unsecured rifle that got sucked into the machine, another cop pressed the emergency button which released industrial amounts of helium, and when they left they dropped and forgot a magazine on the floor. Of course everyone is wondering how the cops didn't see the "Medical Imaging" signs? They also mentioned that the windows were all covered (which is of course something you want for medical patients), and the conclusion was that cops are just stupid. They don't know shit. They don't know what a medical imaging facility is. Cops are really stupid.

Comment: Trump is also known for hardly ever laughing or having a true smile in photos (or even in person).  And even though he is photographed and on video an insane amount (unfortunately for all of us) I can truly say I have NEVER seen him look as happy, care free and comfortable as he does in his multiple pics and videos partying it up with Epstein at his side.  Literally never seen him that happy even in pics with his children.  He clearly was very close to Epstein and felt very comfortable with him.

Comment: &gt;Trump, Epstein said, was almost “functionally illiterate” but did read the Page Six gossip column in the New York Post. He was “incapable” of reading a balance sheet, and any “act of kindness” would have been an accident.

another

&gt;On the tape Epstein can be heard saying, “He’s a horrible human being. He does nasty things to his best friends, best friends’ wives, anyone who he first tries to gain their trust and uses it to do bad things to them.” 

&gt;On one occasion, Epstein alleged, Trump took a woman to what he called “the Egyptian Room” in an Atlantic City casino. Epstein alleged, “He came out afterward and said, ‘It was great, it was great. The only thing I really like to do is f--- the wives of my best friends. That is just the best.’”

I’m always glad to see I’m not the only one. There’s no tolerating intolerance here.

Even if you’re not the person who told my Asian-American wife to “go back where you came from” because “you’re the reason my son had to wear a mask at school,” you know exactly where that person (and others) got that idea from and you chose to vote in line with that knowledge.

Even if you didn’t send death threats to officials in towns and cities all over the country after hearing disinformation about Covid or immigrants eating pets or any other outrageous lies, you know exactly where the people who did got those ideas from and you chose to vote in line with that knowledge.

Even if you didn’t put giant “FUCK BIDEN” signs and flags on your house, barn, or truck while hypocritically accusing LGBTQ+ of corrupting children, you chose to side with the people who did.

Even if you didn’t go to the Capitol on 1/6/21 wearing shirts that say “6 million wasn’t enough” (a reference to the Holocaust) and erect gallows outside of it while chanting the names of ppl you wanted to use them on and beat cops with flagpoles and smear shit on the walls, you chose to side with the people who did and vote for the person who inspired them.

Even if you don’t want America to become a theocracy, you chose to vote for the people who have been explicit for decades about their desire to make religious laws everyone’s laws.

Even if you don’t want women to die from not being able to access healthcare, you chose to vote for the people who are the reason why women ARE dying from not being able to access healthcare.

No matter what moral high ground you’re trying to stand on today, these are all choices YOU made. (By “you,” I mean Trump voters, not “you” as in the person I’m replying to. You’re not so Terrible, Jared.)

Choices have consequences. Those consequences include people judging you for the choices you made.

It’s perfectly fair for people to cut you out of their lives based on these choices you made. They and others they love will be directly affected by these choices you made. They feel betrayed by you. They thought you were better than this, but you chose the empty promise of a few extra bucks over their safety and well-being.

They held in their head the list of blatant lies. You debunk them, and even if they concede that they where incorrect they won't change their mind because they won't accept and experience the uncomfortable feelings that come next after being duped.

After 9 years I don't get how the majority doesn't have their guard up when Trump speaks, he has lied so many countless times and been caught in those lies.

Also let's not underscore the role of misogyny. Exit polling suggested it was as high as 3% that's nearly the margin here, and the article author encountered it quite a lot as well.

It was frankly my top concern when Biden dropped out but I wanted to believe America was better then that. I'm always wrong when I put any faith in American decency. Yet I keep doing it.

And I like this quote from Ann, I think it applies again to this election:

&gt; While she could share no secret recipe to an accurate poll, Selzer emphasized her "polling forward" methodology: focusing on the new data, rather than trying to force trends from previous election cycles or polls.

&gt; "They think that what happened in the last election will be constant. And public opinion, by its very nature, is not constant," she said. "The makeup of the electorate changes enough that you can be blinded from the freight train that’s coming right toward you if your head is turned around looking backward at what happened before.”

Comment: Yeah it's kinda difficult to overstate how insanely bullish for Kamala this poll is. Selzer is arguably the best pollster in the COUNTRY, she's absolutely nailed Iowa in basically every recent election when no one else was close. (2018 governorship was her only miss, still within her margin of error tho)

The margin of error in this poll was 3.4, which doubles because you have to apply it to both candidates. That means in the absolute most pessimistically incorrect error, Trump has a 3.4% lead in Iowa. Iowa has been arguably the furthest right of the Midwest in recent years. If he squeaks out a 49%-46% win there, he almost certainly gets absolutely whomped in the Rust Belt, and is arguably at risk of losing Indiana and Ohio

No poll is gospel, but there's no way to spin this as anything less than catastrophic for Donnie. You LOVE to see it

Comment: Supporting a pedophile rapist fraudster who hates the constitution and shares our national security secrets with our enemy over a woman who wants to restore woman's medical autonomy, provide credit to first time home buyers, provide a tax credit to newly opened small businesses, and doesn't have dementia?

It says a lot about who you are as a person to still support Trump, and none of it good. In haven't talked in years to many folks in my family that went full Trump. They relish in the fact that who they vote for hurts me and my family, so I don't really consider them family anymore. They are just the hateful Christians I grew up with. It's sad because none of them have read the Bible but they use it as a tool to hate everyone not exactly like them.

Comment: From one Gen Z person to another, listen up: 

Your vote matters. Why? Because politicians are more inclined to listen to those who vote than those who don’t. Who you vote for is private, but whether or not you vote is public. If we sit out this election, then our government will not listen to us. So, that’s why we need to step up and vote today, tomorrow, and Election Day. 

And to those who don’t want to vote for Harris and Walz because of Israel and Gaza, I know that what Israel, more specifically Netanyahu, is doing to the Palestinians is horrible and I hate how our government has not done enough to call out Netanyahu for his actions. But let’s be real, Trump is going to give Bibi *everything* he wants on a silver platter, including wiping out the Palestinian people. Do you honestly believe that letting Trump win the election is worth the cost of our country and the lives of the Palestinian people?

[Here’s a link to Bernie Sanders’ take on the matter. I think that it’s important that you and I watch this in case we still have doubts.](https://youtu.be/Vf5MThSniiY)

On top of that, there are other issues on the ballot that are more important than anything in Gaza. Electoral reform, education, economics, healthcare, abortion, LGBTQ, climate change, etc. Those are the things that we need to focus on when we are voting on Tuesday. If Trump and Vance are elected, things will take a turn for the worse, and we and Gen Alpha will have to live with the consequences. 

So please, let’s stop wasting time and get out the vote!

Comment: &gt;Make it make sense.

It is so fucking difficult to explain how bad Trump is to low information voters and people in general because it sounds like you're making stuff up, or that you're biased against him. He does such an unbelievable amount of evil, corrupt, idiotic shit, CONSTANTLY, that people simply don't believe it can all be true when you explain it. 

It's definitely one of the reasons the media has so much trouble dealing with him and informing voters when they do actually bother to try and do that. They sound insane when they try to explain it all.

He's somehow managed to push beyond this sort of "ridiculous bullshit singularity" point where he can basically just say and do whatever the fuck he wants with almost zero repercussions because people won't believe it. 

People think" surely, all of this can't be true" and they start believing the media is in fact just out to get him.

We are privileged that a flight home for her won't hurt us financially and understand the implications of another Trump presidency.

Make a plan to vote. ESPECIALLY if you live in Pennsylvania.

- What is your polling place?
- When will you go?
- Will you go with a friend or solo?
- How will you get there?

Text your friends and acquaintances. Someone younger I no longer work with texted me a question and I asked if they made a plan to vote. I was surprised they had missed the registration deadline and now I feel bad for not reaching out earlier.

It’s easy “Hey this is random but I was thinking of you and I am curious, did you make a plan to vote? I’m here if you’ve got any questions”

Comment: To add context to the numbers which are great, 5,443,067 total ballots were cast in 2020. We are already at ~78% of the 2020 turnout in a state still recovering from a devastating hurricane, purely in early vote. Turnout in this election is going to be crazy, and can very easily overwhelm all the 50/50 polling. 

This is especially relevant in this case when you consider that polling methodologies have no way to account for enthusiasm especially with young voters who are far less likely to respond to polling. They do not have landlines. They do not answer calls from numbers they don't recognize. They're not clicking on links in texts from random numbers. And I think that goes further than the voters we would typically think of as 'young.' I'm 37. I'm not answering that call. I don't have a landline. I'm not clicking that link. I think we are running up on an era where polling just cannot be meaningfully reliable anymore. Too many people are not reachable by the methods used.

I also think we may have an inverse problem to 2016. Trump's support was under-represented, speculatively because people were ashamed to say they were voting for him. In 2024 the cult is in full swing, and they see participation as validation of their 'movement' because of all the messaging of things being rigged against them. I think your average Trump 'base' supporter is far more likely to respond to polling than your typical democrat, precisely because of the extent to which their devotion to Trump has become the largest part of their personality.

I am cautiously very optimistic.

The most I was able to accomplish was to get them to concede that they won't vote for Harris no matter what, and that they don't approve of DonOLD either. We're not in a swing state, so they were willing to at least consider not voting for either.

Trump won Iowa by [8.2% in 2020, at 53.1 to 44.9.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Iowa#:~:text=Trump%20won%20the%20state%2053.1,towards%20Trump%20or%20a%20tossup.)

Said her personal stance doesn't matter,  shes been pregant 4 times and made her choices based on her beliefs and it's other women's choice for their own, you can't tell women what to do.

That said Musk's lawyers saying the winners aren't determined by chance just validates other parts of the DA's complaint regarding deceptive consumer practices. So yeah, it's not a lottery, but now they're basically admitting it's a scam on consumers which doesn't help their case.

2. They are misrepresenting what they are offering participants. It is not based on random chance. So they are persuading people to take part in a fake lottery on false pretences.

Comment: Back when he was first campaigning, several people observed that he spoke "at a fourth grade level." They meant that his vocabulary was tailored to an audience with a low education, but I thought they didn't really get the significance.

Trump *literally* spoke like a child.

"When I'm president, you will have to do what I say!"

"When I'm president, I will get *two* scoops of ice cream, and you will only get one!"

"When I'm president, if you say mean things to me I'll just say 'Get him out of here', and the police will come and drag you away!"

His words and ideas are a child's vision of power. This is by his own admission, in a way:

[quote]
&gt;Donald Trump's temper-tantrum tactics have been explained by the man himself. The frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination admitted to his biographer that, "When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different."

&gt;Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter Michael D'Antonio, whose book, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success, comes out in late September, nabbed the quotable gem during his six hours of interviews with the real estate king . . .

Comment: I'm not sure any Americans alive today have experienced a wrecked economy on the level of what we will experience if these lunatics actually deport 12 million people and force through a 20% sales tax/tarrif on all foreign goods. If they really do those things, we're looking at a Great Depression economic collapse. Add to that Trump's stated aim of pulling out of NATO and cutting funding to Ukraine and you're looking at global instability comparable to the 1930s. The coup de grace would be him withdrawing from climate agreements. This is not the same old, same old we've come to expect from Republicans. This is something entirely different and horrific.

Comment: &gt;"These are the kinds of comments seen for virtually any poll, including mine. The Des Moines Register includes a methodology statement with each story they publish. It's the same methodology used to show Trump winning Iowa in the final polls in 2016 and 2020. It would not be in my best interest, or that of my clients—The Des Moines Register and Mediacom—to conjure fake numbers."

&gt;Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, leads Black voters with 87 percent, NBC News’ poll shows.

&gt; “We have great Republicans running, and you have one of the best of all right here, David McCormick, you know that. Where’s David? Is he around some place?” Trump said.

Comment: Went through this exact scenario with my wife before the 8th referendum. She had a placental abruption at 24 weeks, started bleeding out at home in the middle of the night and went unconscious from the blood loss in my arms as I waited for the ambulance. 

Rushed to hospital and then we had to wait. The baby couldn't survive a birth and was dying. My wife was in the precarious state and could die if she haemorrhaged again. The babies beating heart and the 8th meant they couldn't do anything to protect my wife until the baby died. Mercifully, the baby died at 11am and so my wife got to start to be induced and 14 hours later, gave birth... 

The 8th wouldn't have led to a different outcome, but would have gotten us there more safely if it happened now. I'm so proud of our little island for its progress and mortified by watching the regression we've seen in the US.

Comment: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) expressed strong concerns about former President Trump's potential return to office in 2024, warning that he poses a significant threat to American democracy. Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union," she emphasized that Trump's rhetoric and actions have become more extreme since his previous term, particularly noting his promises of "retribution" and use of terms like "vermin" to describe political opponents.

The congresswoman highlighted the importance of taking Trump's statements seriously, drawing parallels to historical patterns of authoritarianism. She stressed that Trump's current campaign messaging is more dangerous than in 2016, pointing to his explicit statements about seeking retribution and his increased focus on targeting political opponents. Ocasio-Cortez urged Americans to recognize these warning signs and take action through democratic participation

Comment: The 4B movement originated in South Korea, and encourages women to opt out of marriage (*bihon*), childbirth (*bichulsan*), romance (*biyeonae*), and sexual relationships (*bisekseu*). Born out of protests against South Korea’s culture—instances of dating violence, revenge porn, and [gender wage gaps](https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240523050548#:~:text=The%202022%20figure%20showed%20Korea's,OECD%20average%20of%2012.1%20percent.) are widespread—the movement has grown in recent years. South Korea has the [lowest birth rate of any country](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/09/asia/south-korea-government-population-birth-rate-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=South%20Korea%20has%20the%20world's,long%20string%20of%20yearly%20declines.), and despite government incentives, many women still feel the country’s patriarchal structure makes the cost of motherhood too high, and refuse to be “baby-making machines,” according to [reporting from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/opinion/south-korea-fertility-rate-feminism.html)*.*

Although it started in the late 2010s, the movement didn't really gain attention in the US until earlier this year. [New York magazine published](https://www.thecut.com/2023/03/4b-movement-feminism-south-korea.html) a long feature on it in March in which writer Anna Louie Sussman laid out the ways in which 4B adherents were, as Barbieri demonstrated on TikTok, cutting their hair and eschewing beauty products. “The blowback and fear that 4B practitioners experience underscores their conviction that Korea is still a frightening place for women,” Sussman wrote, noting the threats and attacks women, and specifically 4B protesters, receive.

With the election of Trump, and all the threats to reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights and misogyny that entails, women online seemed to be channeling the fear they felt into action in similar ways.

His lack of willpower and willingness to do what was necessary and to prosecute Trump in a timely manner has landed us in a position where he could run again rather than be behind bars or in a permanent house arrest.

Comment: ...and legendary sore losers.

Sorry, edit to previous edit.

~~Edited to add: Trump filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania alleging voter suppression on October 30th which was 6 days *before* the election.~~

~~They're sore losers even before they've lost (or won, in this case).~~

**Sorry, this was a very poor example. It seems that Buck County PA was in the wrong here. Democrats filed suit on the same day over mail-in ballot delays in Erie County so it seems that at least some parts of Pennsylvania were having problems.**

If they were truly interested in voter suppression, they would continue the lawsuit because 'voter suppression bad', right? Anyone taking bets on how quickly they drop it?

**I will point out that, as of November fifth, the GOP and its affiliates are involved in 123 election related lawsuits with the RNC being the plaintiff in 25 of those. The DNC and its affiliates are involved in 41 election related lawsuits with the DNC being the plaintiff in five.**

**Given the discrepancy in who is filing the lawsuits (the Republicans are filing a lot more), I still say the Republicans were feverishly looking for excuses prior to the election (when they thought they might lose). Given the lack of success they had with their election related lawsuits in 2020, their efforts would have been in vain but that obviously hasn't stopped them from trying.**

**In any case, none of this really matters. I still say that the definition of 'sore loser' somehow includes the words 'storming the capital' (at least it should).**

Comment: So weird question here. Are any white people getting this? Or Asians or Hispanics? Cuz if the entity sending this message actually knows what phone numbers are controlled by black people, that's incredibly disturbing.

EDIT: So a lot of people are responding to this and pointing out that it's not actually all that difficult, if you have money and time, to make sure these messages are only sent to black people. So I understand that now. However, I think that raises further questions. 

This isn't Amazon trying to target black people because there's a new product they think black people may want. And this isn't Democrats targeting black people before the election to get the vote out. There's no real benefit to sending this message. And if something takes time and money, you'd expect a benefit. So it seems to just be a really mean thing to do for no real reason.

They’ve been saying forever that they’d never repeal Roe v. Wade and yet as soon as Trump put those heritage foundation justices on the Supreme Court they did it *immediately.* 

Then they said “don’t worry it’s just states rights,” but then gerrymandered red state governments started unilaterally (and in some states literally an automatic abortion ban was triggered) passing stricter abortion laws *immediately.*

Florida’s laws are so f’d up that we tried to pass a citizen referendum to end the effective abortion ban, our own governor *used our own tax money to fight it,* and it got 57% anyway, but because we have the least democratic state in the union, it didn’t “pass” because citizen votes require 60%.

Comment: I talked to 4 Trump supporters about why they supported Trump:

1.  “I agree with him saying we should fucking deport people.”  This person is a heavy Joe Rogan and Theo Von listener for what it’s worth, and is also a woman in her late 20’s.  She hated Kamala and ‘her annoying laugh.’  She was a first time voter this year. 

2.  “Trump is not perfect, but often times God does not choose a perfect vessel to deliver a message.”  Very religious young man in his early 30’s.  Did seem to be genuinely repulsed by Trump, and actually kicked around the idea of voting 3rd party because of how repulsed he was.  

3.  Man in his mid 40’s, very religious as well, sees Trump as kind of a joke, but not in a bad way, so to speak.  Just as kind of a funny and entertaining character.  Not necessarily a MAGA guy, more of a traditional republican who really believes Kamala was going to take his guns.  Also was angry that “they have kitty litter boxes in schools for students who identify as furries.”

4.  Older woman in early 60’s, blames Biden for her doctor not being able to prescribe her alternative medicine 🤷.  Thinks Trump is the candidate that will protect social security, and thinks ‘He’s not really gonna do all that bad stuff he said.’

You figure it out.

Comment: There's a thin silver lining here in the fact that a Biden administration is sandwiched in between two Trump admins. In retrospect, yes, Biden should have refused to run for a second term, which put democrats in a tough spot this election, but there are still some roadblocks in place for Republicans come next term.

Looking at the last eight years alone, two consecutive Trump terms would have been more damaging.

Contrarily, the Trump/MAGA coalition has had four years to prepare an agenda that will bring about a crisis of incompetence at every level government, and pave the way for Republicans to consolidate power. 

If Trump won in 2020, the midterms would have probably been more favorable for Democrats though. and judging by the shit show in the house the last two years, the GOP would have probably been even more powerless due to the Republican factionalism we've seen.

Also, a second consecutive Trump presidency would have completely tarnished his legacy, considering that it was always going to be an uphill battle no matter who won in 2020.

Inflationary issues, economic fallout from the pandemic, foreign conflicts, increased immigration, all of these things would have still occurred under a 2020 Trump presidency. (If you're skeptical about that last one, remember that there was a massive slowdown in immigration due to the pandemic, and subsequent migration/asylum restrictions). And judging by Trump's previous economic and foreign policy record, which was disastrous mind you, it's very likely that some of these issues would have been exacerbated by another Trump term.

However, precisely because Biden is sandwiched between two Trump terms, his admin can forever be scapegoated by Republicans for any and all problems that may arise over the next four years. Whereas, if Trump won in 2020, Republicans would have, realistically, no one to blame but themselves. That probably wouldn't stop them from finding some way to blame Democrats though. 

What's really unnerving is the fact that Donald Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time. He'll take credit for everything he can take credit for, and he'll blame others for everything he can avoid taking responsibility for.

History is repeating itself. At the end of the last two Republican administrations, an economic crisis emerged, both times a Democrat stepped into office and was forced to oversee a recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. And in the midst of this fallout, Republicans took advantage of the opportunity to turn crisis into campaign talking points.

Donald Trump inherited a growing economy in 2017, and he left office in 2020 with the economy in tatters.

Under Trump the national debt exploded.

Under Trump Republicans passed tax cuts legislation that permanently and disproportionately benefited the rich and corporations, legislation that is estimated to cost the government trillions. 

During his first presidency, Trump instigated a trade war with China and his tariff policies did far more harm than good. While his tariff proposals for his next administration are estimated to be far more economically damaging for Americans. 

While he was president, Trump pressured the Fed to keep interest rates low for political gain.

His administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize, weakened labor regulations and protections, reduced overtime pay eligibility, and implemented policies that generally favored employers over employees, taking power away from unions. 

Trump also mishandled the pandemic at nearly every turn, and was responsible, in no small part, for encouraging Republicans to politicize every aspect of COVID. The culture wars that ensued divided Americans during a time of crisis.

It can't be emphasized enough that all of these things and more contributed to economic issues that extended into the Biden administration.

In terms of his foreign policy, and I'll have to make this as brief as I can, he also cozied up to the world's autocrats and dictators, and escalated conflicts in multiple theaters. In fact, during Trump's presidency, Congress had to pass not one, but two historic war powers resolutions due to Trump's dangerous interventionism and his actions that directly led to increased provocations in multiple foreign regions. 

Trump weakened our alliances, emboldened our enemies, withdrew from the working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, abandoned our Kurdish allies, aided the Kremlin agenda and Russian proxy wars, sought to weaken NATO, rescind Russian sanctions, encouraged Russian cyber attacks, crippled our ability to act as peace brokers between Israelis and Palestinians, made allies with the Saudi crown Prince and emboldened and intervened in his violent, warmongering agenda in Yemen. 

Trump literally negotiated with terrorists, caved into the Taliban's pressures, made concessions that were dubious at best, and provided no Afghanistan withdrawal or evacuation plan for the next administration. And this doesn't even scratch the surface. 

Unfortunately, the fallout from all of this will be blamed on Biden in perpetuity, but ironically, if it were not for Biden winning in 2020, the outcomes under Trump would have been far far worse. That's the silver lining here I suppose, and maybe, considering everything, it's thinner than I imagined.

It's a shame that such a large percentage of the American electorate does not make politically informed decisions, that they care more about their immediate circumstances than knowing anything I've mentioned previously about Trump's record.

Walter Lippman, one of the most influential journalists in American history, called the general public an "irrational force," nearly a century ago. This message rings true today more than ever.

*Feelings* are what got Trump elected, and although there might be some of us looking forward to the next Trump administration crashing and burning, let's instead hope that Republicans run into enough obstacles, that any challenges or threats to democracy are met with the appropriate guardrails, and that the ramifications of a second Trump term are just critical enough to encourage Americans to make politically informed decisions moving forward.

Comment: It’s old history at this point, but Bill Clinton was once perceived as an insolent upstart that “cut the line” in American politics. 

Much of the Republican chagrin has to do with perceiving Clinton “stealing” HW’s second term away. 

So by the end of Clinton’s administration, where he was pretty darn popular and has weathered strong GOP smear campaigns - the DNC was *his*.  The wagons had been circled. The Clinton’s were to be protected. 

That party control never went away. It was on display in the famous Obama/Clinton primary with the superdelegates that basically had to rebel to back Obama. 

And Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Faustian bargain that the party would back Obama as long as the Clintonites stayed in control of the DNC so she could run in once Obama’s “line skip” was done. 

That led to the congressional collapse in 2010 - the national party did not do a 50 state strategy. 

That led to the shenanigans of 2016 and the cold-block of Sanders. 

That brought us to the second collapse of  democratic wins in 2018 as well. 

Biden was different though. He didn’t bring in clintonites. He brought in Obama people. And we felt that leadership difference up through the first few weeks of Harris’ campaign. 

But by the time the Debate rolled around, it was Hillary Clinton’s former campaign behind the scenes running the messaging…and who was with Harris when she had to concede? Hillary Fucking Clinton. 

This family is the albatross of the DNC and is squarely responsible for all the compromises, broken promises, and two faced protection of corporate greed that has prevented the party from properly engaging the American population on class challenges and rural betterment - the things Americans actually want. 

Shit. Go watch Walz on the daily show a few weeks ago. He has a throwaway line about rural hospitals and talking about building them and how excited rural voters were for that idea. 

But was that the core message of Harris/Clinton’s people? Nope. It was assumption that voters would already back democrats, and that what we had was a “cool” problem. Just show democrats as being cool and chill vs republicans. 

Nah. Clinton’s get it wrong again. For 24 years. People don’t want cool candidates - they want people that will give them things. And say they will give them things. 

Clintonites never ever speak that way. Instead they promise to fix the problems republicans create, and then they only fix 40% of it…in cities, without disrupting finance, media, or tech (industries that Americans have been screaming to be regulated for 20 years).

But hey. Just don’t remember that Democrats gave you ma fracturing moving to Mexico and China, Telecommunications act of 1996, Digital Millennium Copyright Act, tech immunities for publishing, and were critical in the passage of both Patriot Acts and No Child Left Behind because hey - we’re a *bit* more inclusive than the Bible thumpers. 


I liked Harris. I think she ran as good a campaign as you can in 100 days…but come on. The party itself won’t get its head out of its ass on messaging, and now it’s too late. 

The party was traumatized back in the 90s, with gore in 2000, and has never ever recovered. Obama winning wasn’t the norm, he was the exception…and still struggled to deliver on promise outside of the ACA.

Comment: Why does everyone continue to ignore the biggest problem is the social media algorithms and failing education system that allow the majority of voters to live in a bubble of unchallenged misinformation?  Most of the Trump voters are so radicalized that there is zero policy or message the Democrats could have used to win them over.  The reasons people give for not voting for Kamala are either intentional lies or just complete ignorance and unwillingness to find the information that is easily available.  The things people are asking for are the things the democrats largely offer already, but most people have no idea.  And how can the messaging break through social media algorithms pushed through by oligarchs who own them and want to spread right wing misinformation? What do Democrats do about that?  All this hand wringing as if putting anything on mainstream news media would have reached the people it needed to reach.  Sure there are always things they could have done better, but I honestly don't think we are focusing on the real problem and instead pointing fingers within, which is exactly what they want.

Comment: Here's the big problem -- The American People were sold on trickle down economics. We've been giving rich people money they haven't earned for 50 years. **It hasn't trickled down.** We watched Obama give all the bankers a slap on the wrist for what happened in '08. We watched his VP and Secretary of State try to pretend it wasn't a problem. Now we are at the end of our ropes, so we chose crazy rather than more gaslighting. Trump won't get it either -- he'll probably make it worse.

These pundits are desperately searching for someone to blame instead of looking at the truth. Half of America is too dumb to understand what policies will help them or hurt them.

The only silver lining of the hell of a Trump admin is that those people *will be hurt* by his policies. And when eggs are $10 a carton, and produce doubles in price, maybe they’ll finally understand.

- supreme Court already fucked with the constitution saying that because the part of the constitution written to explicitly keep insurrectionist from running for president wasn’t a law by Congress, but just part of the constitution, It isn’t enforceable. Effectively all parts of the constitution are meaningless until Congress passes a law for each part of the constitution. Real fucked up shit if you ask me.

Comment: &gt;The vote passed the House 63-46 late Tuesday. The state Senate is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday. If it passes the chamber, it would go to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.

&gt;The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday's session began. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.

-

&gt;Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don't align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.

&gt;It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor's control over the State Board of Elections — a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.

-

&gt;The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.

-

&gt;Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:

&gt;* Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It's a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.
* Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.
* Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein's pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.
* Take away the governor's ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.
* Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year — lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.

&gt;Barber said the various changes seem particularly undemocratic given that they all appear directly aimed at rejecting the message voters sent just days ago, in the 2024 elections, about what they want from state government.

It's stuff like this that Democrats need to blast everywhere: news, local publications, local talk shows, radio shows, podcasts, social media, etc. Go on the offensive on communication and keep the voters educated.

Ownership of Private prisons in the United States:

CoreCivic: The largest private prison company in the US, owning, leasing, and operating prisons, jails, and residential reentry centers. CoreCivic was formerly known as the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). Aside, the former Head of Security for that corp was an proven real neo nazi.

GEO Group: Owns almost all private prison beds in the US.

Management and Training Corporation: One of the three largest private prison companies.

Other companies that own or have owned private prison stocks include: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisers, Prudential's QMA unit, and Fidelity.

Obama had signed a bill that got rid of the federal government using private prisons corporations. Trump, of course, reversed this.

"U.S. Department of Homeland Security oversight

In August 2016, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson announced that the group would be reviewing its use of private detention facilities for housing illegal immigrants. This followed the announcement by the Department of Justice that the Bureau of Prisons would phase out its private contracts.\[6\] As of 2015, federal revenues made up 51% of CCA's total income. CCA operates 22 federal facilities with a capacity of 25,851 prisoners. In 2017, however, after the change in administrations, officials under President Donald Trump said that both the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security would continue to use private prisons."

When it comes to the American electorate, nothing –absolutely NOTHING – is more important to voters then “kitchen table issues” (price of gas, physical safety from crime, etc.) – not the character of the candidate, not human rights, not even the survival of democracy itself.

SHOULD things be that way? Highly debatable. ARE things that way? Yes. Dems need to acknowledge that, and campaign accordingly.

Comment: It's a lot easier to go from apathetic to angry than it is to go from apathetic to hopeful. 

Republicans figured this out long ago. They pick 2 or 3 items and spend _years_ making people angry about them to the point that they can print an entire slogan in 3 words on a bumper sticker. They don't even have to be real! They just need to give a person anecdotal perception of personal injustice. 

In 2020 the messaging was simple and straightforward. And people _were_ angry. 

In 2024, despite the existential threat to democracy itself, there weren't 2 or 3 things that the democrats stayed on message and hammered home until normally apathetic people became angry enough to get out and vote. 

As Americans, we've basically resigned ourselves to a completely nonfunctioning government that won't make any progress, ever. People won't get excited about the prospect of change because they truly don't believe it will happen. If Democrats want to increase turnout they need to find a way to tap into rage that can be directed towards the Republican party.

The problem is that they allowed the Republicans (and Trump) to overwhelm that message with daily doses of new bullshit. By responding to every crazy god damned thing that he said or did, you'd lose sight of the fact that tapes came out of Epstein talking about how great of friends they were.

Comment: &gt;The key to understanding the Trump era is that the real divide in America is not between left and right but between pro-system and anti-system politics. 

Good article and this makes sense to me. I think the Dems look at issues as a policy and ideology debate but that's not the prism many voters use.

People on the left keep saying with exasperation, "But what trump policies do you actually support?!" and they are missing the point. His voters aren't going to be swayed by a policy paper. They are voting for a personality.

That was first hit home for me back in 2016 when acquaintances of mine who were pro-Bernie switched to Trump after Clinton edged him out. Their switch seemed crazy to me then, but over time I get it more and more and the Democrats need to figure it out.

Look at the things Trump supporters say and believe, they are voting based on things that aren’t even real or entirely misunderstood. 

They aren’t voting based on on facts or reality but what they are told the facts are. The emperical evidence can be in front of there fact and it doesn’t matter. 

This coupled with the fact they are down economically with no help in sight makes a whole half of the country manipulatable. Add that in with the plain old American conservative values and racism and you have the recipes for a right wing explosion.

Comment: &gt; *The key to understanding the Trump era is that the real divide in America is not between left and right but between pro-system and anti-system politics. Pro-system politics is the bipartisan consensus of establishment Democrats and Republicans: it’s the politics of NATO and other military alliances, of trade agreements, and of deference to economists (as when they say that price gouging isn’t the cause of inflation). Trump stands for no fixed ideology, but rather a general thumbing of the nose at this consensus. The main fact of American politics in the post-Obama era is that an ever larger majority of Americans are angry at the status quo and open to anti-system politics.*

Yes.  This is what the MAGA-sphere has been saying since Bernie was thrown under the bus.  

The 1990's-2000's uniparty that was created by Bill Clinton COULD NOT ENDURE.  One of the two parties was going to be the first to break for populism, whether right populism or left populism, and the one that didn't was going to be left holding the bag of crony politics.  This is why Trump won the presidency, and the Democrats now have the dubious honor of Cheney's support.

The only reason millions of people kept their healthcare is because John McCain said one last fuck you before leaving.

Edit because some comments seem to dislike my choice of words when describing trumps policy. separating immigrant families is evil, botching the response to Covid causing hundreds of thousands of deaths is evil, threatening to imprison your political opponents is textbook bad guy shit.

Comment: Interest rates will be slashed. Prices and housing costs will soar out of control. Wages will freeze, wealth will flow upward at an ever greater rate. Until the whole thing comes to a halt, because only the few are left with spending money. Just like the end of any Monopoly game. And the damage may not be fully felt until 5 years from now. The presidents after may not be able to repair it. All empires fall. This could very well be chapter 2.

Comment: This has been in the republican works for decades. Slowly let money and corporate interests gain power in government, cripple the education system, keep wages low, create dissonance to further divide the population. Now a generation later, people are overworked, poor, and pissed off but they don’t understand why, which makes them gullible and easily manipulated. Now all you need is a demagogue to fan the flames and promise to make it all better if they just untie his hands and let him rule. Simple plan really, it only required patience

I *absolutely* saw that enthusiasm gap early on when it was Biden vs. Trump, but in my areas the enthusiasm came back quickly when Harris took over. Considerably more enthusiasm than I saw for Biden in 2020, when I voted for him mainly because Trump was much worse. In contrast, I actually felt pretty good about Harris in her own right, as did many of those around me.

Then again, the outcome in liberal Boston was never in question.

With all the stories of hours long lines to early vote, Harris/Walz signs everywhere, women being pissed off - literally reproductive rights on the ballot in places! And you compare that to what seemed like a rambling, incoherent old man with 34 felony convictions, people visibly bored and walking out of his already small rallies - I'm absolutely stunned.

Comment: Looking at the numbers some more, this is slowly demonstrating a massive loss in voter turnout for Dems, while GOP improved in turnout marginally. Based on the % trends right now, Harris will end up with \~72-73 million total votes, while Trump will end up with roughly 76 million.

Trump improved his total vote tally by 1 million from 2020.

Harris will have underperformed by \~8 million from 2020.

8 million less voter turnout for Dems is a monstrosity of a stat and says everything about this race:

Propaganda works, it really does. Democrats don’t have an answer to the propaganda machine the Republicans have built over the last 3 decades and that has hurt the country as a whole. 

Hillary and Kamala weren’t bad candidates, Americans are really just dead-set on never having a woman as President. 

This isn’t actually the last election, like people here claim. Everything will fall apart in the next 4 years and it will be dumped on the Democrats lap again for another 4-8 years. This cycle will repeat ad nauseam.

Comment: I said it elsewhere but will say it here too: 

In 2016, we could just blame old white people and reasonably get away with it. But after this, after seeing just what Trump was like, and with a GOP trend among basically every group everywhere, with states like New Jersey being in the single digits, with Trump actually winning the popular vote instead of just the Electoral College, the blame goes to everyone, including minorities who will suffer greatly at the hands of a Republican administration. It's clear that a majority of the American public is willing to vote away their rights because of how it makes them feel rather than based on any semblance of logic. Human lives are too short. Many or most of us will deal with the horrible consequences of this election for the rest of our lives with no chance to reverse or make up for it within that time frame.

As a European, it was clear from the start that Trump didn't have the best interest of US citizens at heart. There are now stories of non-white Trump voters being shocked that they and their families are experiencing more racism.

At the end of the day, Trump promised America that import would come with extra fees, that a significant percentage of essential workers would be deported, that healthcare would be more expensive- the list goes on. Unless you're already extremely rich, voting for Trump would be self-sabotage.

Prices will not come down (stopping/lowering inflation means stopping/slowing the RISE in prices not LOWERING them and those prices are here to stay, it’s a global issue in which we’re doing better than average)

If he’s serious about his tarrifs, prices will mostly go up

The government will be more useless than it has ever been unless you’re a friend of Trump’s

Mass deportation will not occur, just a blanket dragnet on people of color and harassment of their rights

It will be far more difficult to immigrate here

Hate crimes will spike (they did during his last administration, why wouldn’t they again with a campaign even more racist and dehumanizing than the last one?)

Protests will probably turn more violent as Trump has no one to talk him down from deploying the military against them like in his previous admin

Pollution will increase, city infrastructures will decay, public health will be threatened

1000s of career civil servants who have an expertise in their fields (lot of scientists and doctors) will be fired and/or replaced by Trump loyalists who have no clue what they’re doing or will work on behalf of the industry they’re supposed to regulate/preside over

Unions and workers rights will be challenged and likely weakened as Trump judicial appointments make new rulings

Abortion and birth control access are a big question mark imo, Trump really kinda went his own direction against the party line on it, but his judicial appointments will most likely make access to both of those harder depending on the state

Our nation’s influence will be weakened as foreign actors prey upon Trump’s ego and deep insecurities

China will fill the void we leave behind if Trump really goes for the isolationist foreign policy his supporters seem to want, people don’t seem to grasp that foreign aid is not really “foreign aid”, it’s an investment that helps us get something we want from a nation in exchange for an extremely small percentage of our budget

Bibi Netanyahu will get a greenlight to do whatever he wants, so the situation in the Middle East will probably get worse before it gets better

Depending on the emergency, most states (especially those with Democrat governors) will likely be on their own to handle the crisis just as we saw during covid and bc the Federal appointees will likely be people without any real experience/conspiracy theorists loyal to protecting Trump’s image over us, many Republicans also seem to not be in favor of giving FEMA the funding it needs on the Federal level

God help us if RFK Jr. takes over the Health and Human Services Department

And sure, we’ll all probably get a tax cut disproportionately benefitting the wealthy, which will be nice for like a year until prices go up, small businesses can’t compete at all with corporations, and the national debt rises even faster

In short, we will go back to 1939 when America was isolationist and the European countries manufactured their own stuff.

More Gripen, more Rafale, more Eurofighter will be sold throughout Europe and less F-16 and F-35. Eventually Europe will come up with its own stealth fighter.

Sweden, France and Germany will open ammunition plants, tank plants and missile factories all over Europe, the UK might even rejoin the EU.

It really makes me wonder how policy will change because of it. If minorities are now a major backer of trump what does the next 4 years look like? Does he change his rhetoric a little bit or do they keep going the direction it seems and he loses all support in 4 years.

  
I dont like saying it but as a middle age straight white dude that voted Harris I don't think the Ds can run anyone but a youngish normal straight white guy for the next 20+ years. It's not what I think is right but just looking at how this went and how the 2016 election went I think it's fair to say we are not ready for a woman. It's time to play it safe even if that means somethings taking a back seat for awhile. Shut up about any policies that don't mention the economy and housing. That's what people care about. It's sad to say we cant run on purely "this is the right thing to do policies". People care about being able to afford to live and everything else falls way behind.

He was holding on for this exact moment. He was old, his time was coming, and he knew it, and he wanted to hold on just long enough, JUST long enough, to vote for Harris. So that he could see America elect its first woman president before he died. 

Instead, the last president of his lifetime is going to be Donald. Fucking. Trump. A fascist, rapist pig who dropped his pants and shat all over the reputation of the US and the Oval Office. He's going to die knowing that we are all officially fucked. I'll be shocked if he's not dead within the next couple of weeks or so.

Whether he won by 10 million votes or 10 votes, it's all the same. He has both chambers of Congress and 6 SCOTUS votes on his side, so he's off to the races. It's all just a numbers game, and he has the numbers that matter.

* Biden pick will run the ethics office during Trump’s term
* The agency is deeply involved in the nomination process

"The Senate Thursday confirmed President Joe Biden’s pick to lead the main ethics watchdog in the executive branch, one set to be involved in nominee vetting for the entirety of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term.

Senators voted 50-46, along party lines Thursday to confirm David Huitema’s nomination to run the Office of Government Ethics, created after the Watergate scandal, for a five-year term. The OGE—which has lacked a director for more than a year—oversees more than 140 agencies, enforcing ethics rules to prevent financial conflicts of interest among federal employees.

The agency is also heavily involved in the nomination process..."

EDITED TO ADD:

This from the following letter urging his confirmation. I have to believe Biden's choice is much better than someone that Trump might have chosen.....

 [https://www.citizen.org/article/letter-to-senate-urging-confirmation-of-oge-director/](https://www.citizen.org/article/letter-to-senate-urging-confirmation-of-oge-director/)

&gt;One of the most important roles of the Office of Government Ethics is to oversee and advise the presidential transition process. The selection and nomination of most new administration officials takes place during the transition, in which OGE’s vetting of pending nominees for conflicts of interest is most critical. The Office needs to be fully staffed and operational during the course of the transition period.

Comment: It’s a ban that applies to *one person*. This is performative, cowardly hatred.

E: As multiple replies have pointed out, there have been trans staffers and other employees in the Capitol before this election, and they would be harmed by this rule as well. I should have been more specific that this ban *targets* one specific representative-elect, Sarah McBride. Nancy Mace, who proposed this ban, has said so explicitly.

E2: In an effort to stem the flood of replies, I’m going to add my response to the most common comments here. Make no mistake; this ban is the thin end of a wedge. Republicans’ underlying goal here is to punish and denigrate anyone who deviates from extremely rigid, traditional gender roles. This will not be limited to just trans people. Anyone who looks androgynous or who acts outside of their prescribed role (women who live and work independently or don’t wear skirts, stay-at-home dads, gay/bi people, etc) is going to be the immediate next target of this type of ban. 

If you act in a way that conservatives think is inappropriate for the sex they assume you to be, they’ll aim make your life worse until you cave and conform. If the fact that this is openly hateful towards a minority population who already have it incredibly rough (due to all the ways Republicans keep trying to kill them) somehow isn’t enough, you should oppose this ban on the grounds that it is *also* a step towards overturning women’s suffrage, gay rights, and all the progress we’ve made as a society in the past seventy years.

E3: Should have also mentioned this sooner, but no, the answer isn’t to accuse cis people of being trans to get them hurt by this ban as well. All you’re doing by suggesting that is harming the trans people you claim to be defending. Nobody’s gender identity is up for public debate. Saying that it’s fine to “investigate” someone’s gender just because you don’t like them is playing into exactly the kind of rigid gender roles nonsense Republicans want, *and* it signals to trans people that your acceptance of their identity is conditional on your personal approval of their actions.

Comment: One commentator said that Kamala Harris lost because she was held to an incredibly high standard, while Trump was held to literally no standard whatsoever.  

Yeah, that seems right to me.  

Anybody who says it's because she wasn't a good candidate or because she didn't have actual plans or because people didn't like her is too stupid to listen to.  

She lost because of bad information.  People had this incorrect perception that the Biden Administration was responsible for inflation, and so they punished the incumbent Democrats for something they didn't actually do.  And that's just one piece of terrible information that people relied on when making possibly the stupidest decision voters have ever made.

Comment: So just to be clear, the news here is that someone unconnected to Jack Smith predicts that Jack Smith will release a report that will be “eye-opening,” despite the predictor having never seen said report.

I’d love to see that report, but writing an article about a prediction is a big wet fart. The media is already back to their “Trump’s going to be in hot water very soon” bullshit articles like last time. “Damning reports” aren’t going to save us. Don’t get hyped for Mueller 2.0.

Comment: Trump’s plan to appoint a border czar to crack down on sanctuary cities is a dystopian nightmare straight out of a fascist playbook. This isn’t about law and order—it’s about consolidating power through fear, targeting marginalized communities, and dismantling what little accountability still exists in our immigration system.

Sanctuary cities don’t just protect immigrants—they protect everyone by ensuring that local governments can foster trust with communities, allowing people to report crimes and access basic services without fear. Stripping that away won’t make us safer; it’ll just drive people further into the shadows, leaving us all more vulnerable. And let’s be clear: this kind of policy is about creating scapegoats, not solutions.

The Greed Lords and their lackeys like Trump use immigrants as a distraction while they loot the system and leave working people fighting over scraps. Policies like this are designed to stoke division, fear, and hate so we don’t focus on the billionaires rigging the game against all of us.

If this plan becomes reality, we’ll see an even more militarized, authoritarian state—where families are ripped apart, workers are exploited, and fear becomes a tool of governance. It’s a nightmare vision for America, but it’s exactly what Trump and his enablers want: total control, no accountability, and the rich getting richer off the chaos. We can’t let them turn this country into an unrecognizable police state.

Comment: &gt; On November 21, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 9495, the “Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act,” with a 219–184 vote. This bill grants the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of nonprofit organizations by labeling them as “terrorist-supporting.” Notably, 15 Democrats joined Republicans in supporting this legislation.

•	Bill Overview: H.R. 9495 allows the Treasury Secretary, a presidential appointee, to strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status by designating them as supporters of terrorism. This action could be taken without judicial oversight, raising concerns about potential misuse.

•	Bipartisan Support: While the bill primarily received Republican backing, 15 Democratic representatives also voted in favor. This bipartisan support is surprising, given the potential for the bill to be used against organizations that are critical of the incoming administration.
	
•	Potential Implications: With President-elect Donald Trump set to assume office, there are concerns that this legislation could be used to target liberal nonprofits, universities, and news outlets by revoking their tax-exempt status, thereby hindering their operations.
	
•	Democratic Dissent: The 15 Democrats who supported the bill have faced criticism for potentially enabling an authoritarian expansion of executive power, which could be used to suppress dissenting voices and organizations.
	
•	Next Steps: While President Joe Biden is unlikely to sign this bill into law, the incoming administration, with Republican majorities in both chambers, may reintroduce it. The stance of these 15 Democrats in future votes will be crucial in determining the bill’s fate.

Comment: So she was one of his lawyers during the first impeachment. She also has a fairly long association with him. To quote Wikipedia:

&gt; In 2013, Bondi also received criticism following a campaign donation from Donald Trump. Prior to the donation, Bondi had received at least 22 fraud complaints regarding Trump University. A spokesperson for Bondi announced that her office was considering joining a lawsuit initiated by Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, regarding tax fraud potential charges against Trump. Four days later, however, a political action committee established by Bondi to support her re-election, And Justice for All, received a $25,000 donation from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, after which Bondi declined to join the lawsuit against Trump University....

&gt; In September 2016, the IRS determined that the donation to Bondi's PAC violated laws against political contributions from nonprofit organizations, and ordered Trump to pay a fine for the contribution.

His illegal donation to her election campaign (that was definitely not in return for her not charging him with fraud) was not paid back, as his foundation was shut down for all sorts of illegal activity before then.

And that's not the only corruption controversy around her...

Comment: Of course it's Nancy Mace who championed the bill, and of course it's after the first transgender woman is elected to Congress.

From Mace:

&gt; Sarah McBride doesn’t get a say.

And there you have it, Mace is saying the quiet part out loud. This brief remark encapsulates the Republican party's platform. Only *they* are entitled to "a say." Only *they* are entitled to the god given rights afforded to them in the Constitution. *They* get to dictate your rights, and God have mercy if you have any "say" in the matter.

&gt; This is a biological man trying to force himself into women’s spaces, and I’m not going to tolerate it.”

&gt; I’m the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. If some guy in a skirt came by and said, ‘No, that’s my achievement.’ I’m going to be there and standing in the way and saying, ‘Hell no.’ I’m not going to allow men to erase women or women’s rights.”

First of all, trans people statistically do not pose any risk to people in bathrooms and are instead far more at risk of being abused or harassed while trying to use facilities. Yet Republicans, and in typical fashion mind you, pretend like this issue is some widespread, inescapable epidemic.

Think about how ego centric this is too. They're the victims at the center of a trans agenda thats oppressing *them,* "erasing their rights." This isn't about the rights of trans persons, it's not even an effort to address which bathrooms should be reserved for the trans community, It's about *their* feelings, no one else's. It's about what kind of experience they're entitled to while using a public bathroom, and f*ck the feelings of the trans woman, this is about me me me.

Someone should ask Mace, or any Republican congressman for that matter, to identify any cases of trans people harassing someone in a public bathroom. And you know what, for the sake of argument, let's say they do identify a case, It still doesn't mean that one incident is broadly representative of how all trans persons behave.

What's particularly unnerving here is that Republicans like Mace just presume they will be tormented in public bathrooms by trans people, that they are under attack, that they are the victims here, when in reality, it's not only a presumption attempting to justify discriminatory policy, but it's people like McBride who are the actual victims of harassment in these scenarios.

So Mace and her fearmongering coalition of bigots ignore or outright dismiss the fact that it's trans individuals who are much more likely to be hassled in public bathrooms, while Republicans like Nancy are the actual enablers of that harassment, and they're basically resorting to a form of victim blaming.

These Republicans just suspect that trans people prioritize using bathrooms to make others feel uncomfortable, that whenever a trans individual uses a public bathroom, it's, first and foremost, for the purpose of provoking others. Instead of the fact that, you know, they're just there to do their own business, and mind their own business for that matter, just like most people who use the public restroom.

Republicans presume a whole lot about the LGBTQ community. And most of it is rooted in their own insecurities, their prejudices, their hate. So they pass laws to validate these feelings. If it's written into law, it becomes an official acknowledgement. If there's a law prohibiting Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom, it must be for a reason. And now that reason becomes a reality for them.

While make no mistake, this is only one step away from Republican men refusing to share a bathroom with people like McBride. Which is one step away from either banning her from using public bathrooms altogether, or designating a bathroom strictly for people like McBride. You know, just like how bathrooms were segregated a century ago.

This is what Republicans do, they incessantly vilify out-groups, foreigners, gay and trans people, "the other," so that they can create scapegoats and boogeymen. Then these scapegoats and boogeymen become the targets of their outrage, their hate, their blame, their grievances, their discrimination and ultimately, their legislative efforts. And all of these things are part of a kind of feedback loop.

Their fears, their hate, their hostility towards these groups, and the misinformation and propaganda they generate, help them justify the legislation they pass, and that legislation helps reinforce their fears and contempt for those groups even more, which then strengthens their case for more discriminatory and suppressive measures, and around and around it goes.

Comment: Musk's Twitter takeover resulted in the loss of 6,000 jobs, an 80% decline in company value, around 50% loss in revenue, increased debt burden, and still has a negative cash flow.

Comment: His extremely hands-on attitude regarding the Cybertruck is another great example. Reports suggest he was all over the place, cutting this and that to reduce costs, increase efficiency, etc. Instead they got dogshit build quality, comical errors in design and execution, and they can't even get recalls (thousands of vehicles!) right.

The stupidest part for my taste is that we, as a people, already know how to build trucks.

Comment: Really good article by a man who was in the Hungarian National Assembly as Orban established his autocratic rule there.

There is lots of advice in this article, but some specific tips for Democrats include:

·       Commit to left-populist economic policies such as “breaking the chokehold of pharmaceuticals over the health system”

·       Fighting inflation 

·       Increasing the minimum wage 

I assume left-populist economic policies might include things like:

·       More affordable college

·       More financial assistance for college

·       More high-tech, high-paying jobs in places where people feel they are not getting ahead

·       More training for high-tech, high-paying jobs

The author also writes:

“Progressive influencers: Time to log in and post away — there’s a narrative battle to win.”

When autocrats flood the zone with lies the defenders of freedom have to flood the zone with demonstrable truth.

For people who want to start rolling back the maga tide in 2026 I think this is an excellent article to read and think about.

Comment: &gt;A Republican senator has blocked the promotion of a general who oversaw troops in Kabul during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to a Senate aide.

&gt;The move by Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin follows threats from President-elect Donald Trump to fire senior officers and officials who oversaw the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan in 2021. It also comes as Trump’s transition team weighs possible court-martial proceedings against current and former officers involved in the withdrawal, as NBC News previously reported.

&gt;Army Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue was nominated for promotion to become a four-star general and to oversee U.S. Army forces in Europe. His nomination was among more than 900 proposed nominations sent to the Senate but Donahue’s was put on hold by Sen. Mullin, according to the Senate aide.

Comment: You’re completely right. You can’t “gotcha” these assholes. Jean Paul Sartre said it about anti semites but it really applies to any bigoted reactionary conservative

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

How did people vote for him when 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists have said in black and white that Harris's program is “vastly superior” economically?

Comment: Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) introduced a bill this week to legally erase transgender people, entitled the “Defining Male and Female Act of 2024.” He claimed that the bill will stop what he called the Biden administration’s attempt to “replace biological sex with dangerous radical gender ideology.”

The bill is a long list of terms and definitions, where words like “father” and “girl” are defined with the words “male” and “female.” Those two words are then defined as “an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes [sperm or eggs for male or female, respectively] for fertilization.”

Marshall claims that this would prevent transgender people from participating in school sports and would ensure that “restrooms, locker and dorm rooms, prisons and shelters for victims of sexual assault” would have “sex separation.”

These people are fucking obsessed. Imagine what could be achieved if they actually put this much effort into worthwhile causes?

And they haven't even taken over yet.

Forgive us if we're kind of fucking freaking over the fact that they have prioritized going after trans people since the election. This is taking precedence over everything else, apparently.

Remember the first months after he took over Twitter? His entire game plan was quite literally to turn off parts of the code and see what beaks, which frequently lead to the site being totally fucking broken for extended periods of time. He also reduced the employee base to a skeleton crew.

Now apply that same game plan to the US government. He's going to want to shut off essential services and "see what beaks". Except now instead of not being able to rage tweet people are going to die from lack of government services. This is not hyperbole people will die.

The only thing that gives me hope is that he's leading a fake government agency with no real power. But we'll see how that goes.

Comment: Yeah, they were hyping the media about cutting down $500 billion in Federal spending, and using some examples as planned parenthood ($300m), The Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($535m), international organizations ($1.5b) which amount to a whole 0.467% of their proposed cuts. 

I think the elephant in the room is that defense and VA account for 67% of all federal employees. That's literally where most of the money goes - as far as salaries go. *They've promised to reduce the federal workforce to a quarter.*

Another factor is that red states and counties have some of the highest number of federal employees. 

If they're going to make big cuts, it is literally impossible to not also fire their own voters. So let's see how that plays out.

Yes, that's the whole point. To break it. To propose impossible things and terrify federal agencies and demonize the federal government and add dysfunction.

When a party is captured by corporations, hates oversight, regulations, and taxes, and is actively calling for departments to end, there's nothing ambiguous about the goals anymore. They want anything perceived to cost their corporate interests one penny to end, no matter how counterintuitive or harmful to their constituents.

Honestly, given that Trump has already said in several ways that he will be violating the oath of office the moment he takes office, it’s within the SCOTUS-granted right of the executive to refuse to surrender his office without an oath-bound replacement. It would be akin to surrendering the office to a foreign invader, which is a delicious irony.

His devout followers are as unamerican as they come, and their betrayal of this country should be remembered for years to come. It won't be here, because they are in control, but I hope history remembers these fuckers for what they are.

Rick Roth, a third generation farmer, told NPR that state Senate Bill 1718 was designed to "scare migrants." But he admitted that he and his colleagues were unprepared for the destabilization it would cause among the state's more established immigrant communities.

Roth said, he hopes to persuade long-time immigrant residents who already have jobs not to flee the state because the law "is not as bad as you heard."

Comment: That's the point. Remember, there are exemptions from tariffs, applied for through a special process governed by Trump's people. So if you give a big enough campaign donation / bribe, you get to keep on operating while all your rivals go bankrupt. And of course, you'll have to never criticize the president or donate to the Democrats. This is exactly the playbook Putin used in Russia in the early 2000s to bring the oligarchs to heel: back me and get rich, stand up for democracy and get demolished. Republicans are going to steamroll the next election.

Comment: Every single one of these "now they're finding out / leopards eating faces" articles need to be rejected as the distraction tripe that they are. There is no "regretful Trump voter" backlash forming. Someone reading this once posted that stupid quote from lindsay Graham about how Trump would destroy the party. Yeah, how does that look now? MAGA may be full of idiots but it's not a movement that will collapse anytime soon due to incompetence or incoherence or dissent amongst its ranks. 

Everyone here was sure that America was ready to "move on" from Trump and was tired by his act. Well, America ain't. And articles like this are preaching to the choir to provide that same false sense of reassurance for the educated half of the country and to try and instill a sense of sympathy and hope for the uneducated other half that they haven't been fully corrupted. These are all coded as "the arc of history bends towards justice" articles.

Well, the arc isn't bending that way. We need reporting that will acknowledge that, and orients itself towards the struggle ahead rather than reassuring us that we can just ride this out and Republicans will naturally come to regret their choices.

Interested parties wake up to the real and serious danger and lobby hard for a climb down. 

Trump extracts some minor concession in return for dropping his threat and claims victory through playing hardball.  The fans go wild with ecstatic approval!!  In your face, Libs! 

3-6 months later the press gets around to analyzing the deal and determines Mexico took us to the cleaners. 

Trump cannot renegotiate because it would make him appear stupid and weak. 

Rinse and repeat with Canada, China, UK, every EU country and most especially Russia.

Comment: Quoted from the article: “you’re all that matters to me.… I’ll never let you down.” She also wrote to him that she wanted to reclaim the “synergy” they had. “We’d talk about everything and nothing.… I want to bring you joy,” Harp wrote. “To feel like we can get through a day without ever having to talk ‘work.’” And it isn’t particularly one-sided either. The *Times*, which viewed the letters, reported that Trump apparently commented that Harp was the only member of his team that truly cared about him.

Comment: Smith wasn't moving slowly. His initial proposed schedule for the J6 trial was so aggressive that Chutkan seemed mildly amused by it. There were many delays but that was down to Trump's lawyers bringing up every bullshit argument they could think of. Go look at some of the motions and counter-motions--there are places where Trump's lawyers cited things that didn't say what they claimed, sometimes even the opposite of what they claimed. Trials are slow when you have money for lawyers and this is nothing new. Even Shakespeare referred to "the law's delay" as being one of those shitty things we face in life.

I think Smith probably did the best job anyone could have with the cards he was dealt.

However, the draft dodging piece blows my mind. When Clinton ran, my parents were one of many conservatives that were screaming about how Clinton was a draft dodger. Now, with Trump, if you bring up his draft dodging - he’s the smartest man ever for not serving.

Anyway in 2016 suddenly Trump was amazing and I haven't heard a god damn word from them about him being a draft dodger. 

It's really easy to say "Republicans have no principals, and they actually don't care about anything they say they care about because they really just care about their team winning" when it's faceless people you don't know. But it sure becomes real when it's your own family displaying that behavior.

I honestly couldn't tell you what they believe in politically. What matters, what's important, what's disqualifying in a candidate, that all is changeable with the candidate. In the end, to them good policies and traits are those that the Republican candidate has, and bad policies and traits are those that the Democratic candidate has. I have never even heard them say anything critical of the Republican candidate. Meanwhile every Democrat voter I know will say things like "I like Biden/Obama/etc, but I didn't like X and I wish he took a different stand on Y." Meanwhile my parents are just like "The Republican candidate at this moment is exactly what this country needs, no notes."

Comment: Not mentioned in the article, but this also has a chilling effect on other minority groups within the Military.  A gay or lesbian soldier might look at their trans brethren getting ousted, and start to worry for themselves.  After they've finished with the trans individuals, they  may move on to other "undesirables".  This likely includes women, regardless of their sexuality.  

Then there are those around them.  Why promote or support someone of a minority group when you know the C-in-C is against them?  They might not be long in their position, and discrimination against them is no longer considered problematic.  

Why respect your superior if you know they are part of the "undesirable" group?  Why treat your fellow soldier with respect when you know the President doesn't?  

This is an awful move and only serves to undermine the US military.

And the republican base is so brainwashed that there is no getting through to them that they are voting for people that hate them. Nearly all of us Americans have way more in common with each other than not - we all are in this fight against billionaires - yet the base is so spun up on what genitals people have and where they pee. It's just so incredibly sad that people actively choose division, at all our own expense, rather than progress.

Spoilers alert for this season of the show:

1) he will pump and dump the economy which benefits the oligarchs

2) he will prove that his surface level understanding of anything is insufficient to be a decision maker.  we will hear the phase “who knew X was so complicated” where X will be things like tariffs, the economy, healthcare, foreign policy, etc. 

3) there will be many domestic crisis.  Some self inflicted due to lack of knowledge about something or because he put someone in charge of something who is better suited as a mannequin in a Macy’s window display.  

4) there will be one or more global crisis that requires a competent response to avoid tragedy but he will instead seek money making opportunities and political advantage.

5) there will be high turnover in the administration with a revolving door of highly incompetent stooges who have no business in any government position.

6) He will promise to deliver X in two weeks which will never come because he is a liar.

New this season:

* the majority of the functional part of government that affects people daily lives will be fired and replaced by incompetent stooges who swear allegiance to trump and have no other qualifications for jobs that really required skilled players.

He’s a giant man baby with the temperament a toddler. He wants to withhold disaster aid from states that are mean to him, purge generals who aren’t loyal enough, jail members of the press who don’t kiss his ass, he’s appointing cabinet members who seem uniquely qualified to destroy their departments. None of this is normal. None of this fine. I’m not overreacting. We knew how much a piece of shit he was in 2020 and we know how much a piece of shit he is now. He’s dumb, vengeful and willing to sell the government to the highest bidder.

Comment: It looks like the next House is going to start with an *extremely* narrow GOP majority, 220 Republicans vs. 215 Democrats, representing a net *loss* of 2 seats for the GOP compared to the 2022 elections. It will be the slimmest House majority in modern history. In addition, Gaetz already resigned, so that's one fewer seat already, and that combined with Stefanik and Waltz joining Trump's administration, and it looks like it will temporarily be a 217R-215D majority, meaning Republicans losing a single vote means the vote will fail. I really don’t think Trump will be able to get much of his legislative priorities achieved through Congress in his second term.

In fact, if it wasn't for 3 seats that North Carolina Republicans gerrymandered into safe GOP districts after the 2022 elections, Democrats would have flipped the House of Representatives by the narrowest 218-217 margin. So much for Trump's "mandate."

Comment: Bits from the [article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-trump-impeachment-vindman-treason-b2654951.html):

&gt;Vindman, who [testified](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-hearing-vindman-williams-ukraine-call-bribery-schiff-a9209721.html) in 2019 that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, cited [reports](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187) that Musk had been engaged in secret conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin dating back to 2022. He then expressed concerns that Musk, who has [federal contracts](https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2024%252F10%252F20%252Fus%252Fpolitics%252Felon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Felon-musk-trump-impeachment-vindman-treason-b2654951.html&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Felon-musk-trump-impeachment-vindman-treason-b2654951.html&amp;article_id=2654951&amp;author=Justin+Baragona&amp;tag=Elon+Musk%2CAlexander+Vindman%2CDonald+Trump%2CWhite+House&amp;section=World&amp;category=Americas&amp;sub_category=US+politics&amp;updated_time=2024-11-27T21%3A48%3A39.000Z&amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;ref=www.independent.co.uk&amp;utm_source=independent&amp;fbclid=&amp;gclid=) through his SpaceX, Tesla and Starlink companies, may have shared “state secrets” with Putin.

&gt;“And \[Putin’s\] been using the richest man in the world to do his bidding. In some cases, that’s encouraging him probably to support Donald Trump,” Vindman told MSNBC. “That’s not speculation. We see how far in Elon has gone. And then using Twitter as a disinformation platform.”

&gt;Reacting to a [clip](https://x.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1861813646453534823) of Vindman’s remarks, Musk [tweeted](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861820349270335817): “Vindman is on the payroll of Ukrainian oligarchs and has committed treason against the United States, for which he will pay the appropriate penalty.”

&gt;After Vindman first testified before the House impeachment inquiry about Trump’s actions towards Zelensky, Fox News hosts and GOP lawmakers said he “has an affinity for Ukraine” while suggesting he was simultaneously advancing Ukrainian interests while working in the White House. As reported by The Intercept at the time, the [“smear tactic”](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/29/republicans-accuse-colonel-vindman-jew-fled-soviet-persecution-dual-loyalty/) leaned heavily on antisemitic tropes, especially since Vindman himself is Jewish.

&gt;“Vindman is both puppet &amp; puppeteer. Question is who pulls his strings,” Musk wondered in 2022 after Vindman commented on Musk’s purchase of Twitter. “Musk’s tweet — deliberately or not — evoked an antisemitic trope that Jews are puppeteers who secretly wield power over various institutions or that they are puppets of the Israeli government,” *The Jerusalem Post* [observed](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-723510) at the time.

Check out the $3.5 billion one they put in Peru.

He campaigned on this and became the frontrunner. It wasn’t this position that cost him. It was his brain fart. 

That same debate, audience members roared their approval at the idea of letting people without health insurance die outside the ER. That’s how morally bankrupt the GOP and its voters are and have been since way before Trump.

Comment: I don’t know what it says about Musk or Trump or their children that Musk is hundreds of times wealthier but his children have disowned him whereas Trump’s children display continual loyalty.  

Are Musk’s kids decent humans?  

Are Trump’s kids opportunistic monsters?  

Or is Musk that much more annoying than Donald Freaking Trump that his own kids don’t want him?

I dunno.

Edited for style

Edit 2:  another passing thought: the way Elon Musk treated his children is probably worse *than anything the public knows about him*.  Think about the depths of shittiness this man has probably reached.  Think of the Brad Pitt revelations and how horrid he acted with his family.

Comment: It's looking like Republicans will only have 220 seats in the House, representing a net loss of 2 seats compared to the 2022 midterms, and the slimmest House majority in almost a century. In addition, the GOP is about to temporarily lose 3 Representatives (until a special election to fill their seats) to Trump's administration. With such a slim majority, it's pretty likely that Trump won't be able to accomplish any of his more controversial legislative priorities through Congress in his second term. So much for his "mandate."

In fact, this means that if it wasn't for the 3 seats that North Carolina Republicans gerrymandered into safe GOP districts after the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats would have flipped the House of Representatives by the narrowest 218-217 margin. Don't let anyone tell you this election was a landslide. Democrats lost the House only due to blatant gerrymandering in North Carolina.

Comment: &gt;**Overnight, Russia carried out a horrific aerial attack against Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities report that Russia launched nearly 200 missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure, depriving Ukrainian civilians of access to electricity.**

&gt;This attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression.

&gt;On this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: the United States stands with you. Earlier this year, and at my direction, the United States began prioritizing air defense exports so they go to Ukraine first. 

&gt;The Department of Defense has delivered hundreds of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine, as a consequence of this decision, and further deliveries are underway. 

&gt;For months, my Administration has been working to help Ukraine increase the resilience of its energy grid in preparation for the winter, and the Department of Defense continues to surge other critical capabilities to Ukraine, including artillery, rockets, and armored vehicles.

&gt;Russia continues to underestimate the bravery, resilience, and determination of the Ukrainian people. The United States stands with more than 50 countries in support of Ukraine and its fight for freedom.

Lots of awkward exchanges where the conversation just doesn't flow, even between themselves. Lots of weird responses when I suggest working on group projects in person. 

The worst was the day after the election where a bunch of classmates were wearing trump garbage and wouldn't stop talking about how much better things are going to be with low interest rates (?). And this is in SoCal. It was strange.

Comment: To quote the guy moving up...

“I regularly used to tell people that the fastest way to move up in the government is to just screw up, and the bigger the screwup, the bigger the promotion. Every person implicated in your mistakes has an interest in covering up what they did, so they will promote you. That means the people at the very top are usually the most immoral, unethical people in the entire agency.”

Comment: It is imperative, is an obligation that all blue states need to gerrymander according to the efficiency gap. 

(Efficiency gap: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_gap)

Gerrymandering, according to the efficiency gap, will see blue states gerrymander to counter and compensate republican gerrymandering elsewhere.

This is needed because gerrymandering is not democratic, is autocratic.  

You can't outvote gerrymandering. That means dozens or more GOP seats are elected with ZERO votes in federal and states races if you count proportionally.

Example: Check the NC state house how egregious this is. The GOP got a supermajority with only 47.5% of the popular vote, but that got them 57.25% of the seats. They don't have any legitimacy. 

Democrats won 51.21% of the popular vote but only got 42.19% of the seats. This is the actual stealing of your representation.

This has to be done in federal and state races.

Comment: Reminder: 

The New York Times ran **38** articles with the word Trans in its title from October 1-Nov 15.

In that same time, they ran only 6 articles with the word "farm" in it, 2 of which were Food Recipe articles, and 0 of the remaining 4 articles talked about Trump's anti immigrant policies in his first term leading to crops rotting and small farmers going bankrupt.

The New York Times wanted to spread trans panic among liberal and centrist voters, and didn't want to inform anyone about Trump's actual actions, probably because the people who pay them with advertising, bought up the bankrupted small farms during Trump's first term and don't want light shed on that.

Now they want to act like they're a voice for the resistance LMAO.

Comment: [Full List of US Presidents Who Have Pardoned Relatives](https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-presidents-who-have-pardoned-relatives-joe-hunter-biden-1993960)

&gt; **Donald Trump**

&gt; Charles Kushner – Father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, convicted of tax evasion and witness tampering, and recently nominated by Trump as the U.S.'s ambassador to France.

🤔

Obviously there are legitimate reasons why Biden pardoning his son should give people pause, but Trump should give up his 'holier-than-thou' attitude in calling Biden's pardon a "miscarriage of justice," when he has not only pardoned a relative, but is literally appointing him to be ambassador to France. And let's not forget Trump pardoned some of the worst people in America:

&gt; Indeed, by any fair measure, Trump’s record on pardons is arguably the worst in American history. During his first term, he effectively wielded his pardon power as a corrupt weapon, rewarding loyalists, completing cover-ups, undermining federal law enforcement, and doling out perverse favors to the politically connected.

&gt; Trump saw presidential pardons as get-out-of-jail-free cards for his friends and associates, engaging in the kind of brazen corruption that would’ve defined his term were it not eclipsed by other breathtaking scandals.

Comment: Trump pardoned his  son-in-law's dad, two of his campaign managers, his national security advisor, his coffee boy, his attorneys,  his co-conspirators, donors, and war criminals convicted of first degree murder.    Most of the other 200+ people  he pardoned were similarly connected to him, or friends of celebrity surrogates he invited to the white house on personal business.

Several of  the people he pardoned are coming back in government positions during his second term.

  
Oh, and he committed sedition, fraud,  rape, espionage, and campaign finance violations, and got a plurality of voters this time around.

When he won in 16 I wanted to know everything I wanted to be informed I wanted to make sure I knew why I hated him and why this was horrible.  It made me depressed, it made me drink a lot and I didn’t even realize it but I was so upset about the state of the country that I didn’t wanna live it in soberly most of the time.  

I refuse to live that way again. I’m gonna vote like always, I’m gonna look up policies when it’s election time. But I’m not arguing with anyone, I’m not gonna let these fuckers get me mad, I’m angry not sad this time but I’m being mindful that anger doesn’t have to be my constant driving force like depression was back then. 

I just know that for the next four years the only thing I care about it my life and my wellbeing and hopefully we make it to another election where something changes

This time...I just can't do it again. I unfollowed everything and everyone as well. Canceled all my subscriptions. I shut my Instagram down. No Blue Sky, no Threads. No Apple News, Google News. No Pod Save America. I have Facebook just because my daughter's school uses it. I have reddit. That's it. 

I studied political science in college. I worked in DC for a major right wing think tank, oddly enough. I was also a journalist myself for a time. I have volunteered for campaigns. 

This was my passion....government. Politics. News. 

I have to give it all up because it's disgusting now. And it has never been more disgusting and dangerous. I've seen it from the inside. 

I have a seven year old now. I am trying to keep her life steady. I am trying to plan how to save her if necessary. My focus now is keeping my immediate family safe. We cannot depend on any institutions to save us. Not even journalism. 

It's all about to be destroyed. 

I have wanted to drink so much since the election. I used to go months and months between a single drink. Now it's a week. I don't want it to get worse than that. I know I have to stay focused. I have to stay healthy in case we have to run. (My husband is a naturalized citizen born in Mexico so I'm scared.)

My mother is brainwashed MAGA now and we're probably never going to speak again after our last interaction. I barely even care. 

I am in the mindset of microhappiness right now. No delusions that there will be anything to look forward to on the macro level. 

I will do what I can but this country is like an addict at this point....there's no helping these people until they want to help themselves. And they'll have to hit rock bottom first. No joke. 

I just wanted to respond because you articulated so much of what I'm feeling and I totally get it. Exact same feelings. 

All I have going right now is the knowledge that I'm not alone. I might feel alone but there's many of us out there who feel the same. 

Take care.

Comment: Son,

I have tried to keep quiet about your character and behavior, but after listening to the way you made Samantha feel today, I cannot stay silent. And as a woman and your mother I feel I must speak out..

You are an abuser of women — that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.

I am not a saint, far from it.. so don’t throw that in my face,. but your abuse over the years to women (dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing, belittling) needs to be called out.

Sam is a good mother and a good person (under the circumstances that you created) and I know deep down you know that. For you to try to label her as “unstable” for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you? She did not ask for or deserve any of what has come to her by your hand. Neither did Meredith.

I know you think this is one big competition and that we have taken her side… bunk… we are on the side of good and that is not you. (Go ahead and call me self-righteous, I dont’ care)

Don’t you dare run to her and cry foul that we shared with us… that’s what babies do. It’s time for someone (I wish it was a strong man) to stand up to your abusive behavior and call it out, especially against women

We still love you, but we are broken by your behavior and lack of character. I don’t want to write emails like this and never thought I would. If it damages our relationship further, then so be it, but at least I have said my piece. \[Redacted\]

And yes, we are praying for you (and you don’t deserve to know how we are praying, so skip the snarky reply)

I don’t want an answer to this… I don’t want to debate with you. You twist and abuse everything I say anyway. But… On behalf of all the women (and I know it’s many) you have abused in some way, I say… get some help and take an honest look at yourself…

His name isn't associated with my phone number and i live 3,000 miles from the state he died in. When i asked the callers about it they said he was listed on their voter rolls. I immediately called my mom who had been in charge of his estate when he died. Indeed, someone had attached my phone number and he appeared in that state's voter rolls. My mom alerted the election office and the calls stopped.

And for the record, Biden's pardons, not just for Hunter are for non-violent crimes and for legitimate reasons. In Hunter's case, the gop pressured the judge/prosecutors to throw the plea deal that was promised. This was a political hit-job (and no, not the same for Trump who did a lot of actual illegal stuff).

Comment: "“This morning I have been pondering a nearly forgotten lesson I learned in high school music. Sometimes in band or choir, music requires players or singers to hold a note longer than they actually can hold a note. In those cases, we were taught to mindfully stagger when we took a breath so the sound appeared uninterrupted. Everyone got to breathe, and the music stayed strong and vibrant… [In] “protest fatigue” – we will literally lose our will to continue the fight in the face of the onslaught of negative action. Let’s remember MUSIC. Take a breath. The rest of the chorus will sing. The rest of the band will play. Rejoin so others can breathe. Together, we can sustain a very long, beautiful song for a very, very long time. You don’t have to do it all, but you must add your voice to the song. With special love to all the musicians and music teachers in my life.”

They dug as deep as they could to find something, anything, and nabbed Hunter on lying on a form to buy a gun and evading taxes. Crimes he has pled guilty to.

Comment: Things will be a *lot* weirder in 2028 though. 

Because Trump has no successor. Even if he DOES get some kind of miraculous quirk that lets him run again in 2028, the dude is literally 1 and 3/4ths feet in the grave already. He's simply not going to last that long. 

Everyone keeps saying Vance will take his place, but I don't see it. He doesn't have an ounce of Trump's charisma and I can't see him taking the reigns of MAGA. Same with DeSantis or any of these other pretenders to the throne. 

His kids are unlikable dipshits who will fold like fucking paper after Trump croaks. They don't have the shit. They're just the Succession brood writ real.

But there's no one else. Trump has not bothered grooming or making his supporters prepared for someone new to lead him. He's likely just going to keel over from a grabber and leave his entire administration and movement in total disarray.

Honestly, I think in the next four years we're going to see a media figure or someone in the streaming community come in like a dark horse and take over the movement. 

Someone young enough and non-establishment enough could revitalize the party, especially given it's popularity among young men.

Could be someone like Rogan, or someone younger, but I think they're all going to be seeing the potential here. They can court new-money donors like Musk and Thiel and other tech bros. 

The big challenge for MAGA is going to be getting loyalists in congress. This is where they've really stalled. MAGA congresspeople generally do horrible in local elections, because Republican voters don't like to shit where they eat. They're happy to send a ranting lunatic to DC like lobbing a frag grenade, but with a few notable exceptions, they don't follow suit locally. That's why Democrat governors and congresspeople outperformed Harris on local ballots.

I’d love to be wrong and see an AOC presidency, but that would take a huge shift.

Comment: Hijacking this thread to share the pardon link and statement text:

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/

&gt;Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. 
 
&gt;The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases.   
 
&gt;No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. 
 
&gt;For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.

Comment: I work for social justice orgs and interviewed GenZers prior to the election to capture their stories. Here are stories almost every GenZer I spoke with shared with me:

\- They don't believe that corporations or government cares about their needs or will protect them.  
\- They don't trust any media - including social media - to speak the truth. All media are manipulative and self-interested.  
\- They care about local issues, such as cleaning up their neighborhood, because it's tangible and success is attainable.  
\- They don't trust emails from orgs like MoveOn, DNC, etc. because they're run by elites who don't care about them.  
\- The BLM marches showed them that trying political engagement on a mass scale won't neccesarily create change.  
\- Voting in an election won't help them if the candidates and parties are controlled by elites.  
\- They long for some form of foundational change, but don't know what it is. They do care about the world, their future, and each other, but feel powerless. No one is speaking to/for them.  
\- They know they're perceived as self-involved, lazy, etc. but they see their behavior as self-protection.

They raised other issues important to them such as mental health, disruptive technology, etc.

Of course, not every GenZers thinks the same way, and most of those I spoke with were college grads (a few chose not to go or dropped out), so class may be a factor. But the overall theme to their stories were of indifference about participating in a political process that is indifferent to them.

Also, I'm not saying I'm right, or they're right. Just sharing what they told me.

EDIT:

Thanks for the thoughtful responses. Some clarifications:

\- The term "elite" is mine - which I've overused! It does not reflect their language.

\- When I spoke with GenZers we didn't discuss particular candidates or policies unless they brought them up.

\- I spoke with an equal number of men and women.

\- The interviews were conducted before October 7/Gaza protests.

\- I'm fond of bullet lists.

Comment: They’re doing their due diligence which is good. The problem is that we take the earliest projections of the results and that’s what sticks. I expected some changes in the final results, but once the news declares “bush wins Florida” and then no wait, maybe he didn’t, then it looks like there’s shenanigans and accepting the real results is “stealing” from the candidate who didn’t actually win. It’s like the Olympics medal for gymnastics this year. It got messy real fast.

Comment: "For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. "

Comment: They can and will, they're the party of hypocrisy and double standards. Remember how they refused to vote on Obama's pick for a judge(over 200 in fact) as he was a "lame duck" and sat on it for 11 months till Trump was in office? And then Ruth Bader Ginsburg drops dead just before Trump is about to be replaced and they filled that seat in less than two months.  
You can't shame these people, they have no shame.  
EDIT: I got the time they sat on the nomination wrong and corrected it.  
EDIT PART DEUX: Mitch "The Lich" McConnell and the rest of the Republicans sat on over 200 judge confirmations, my comment has been changed to reflect that information.

Comment: Biden, keep going. You have immunity granted by the Supreme Court. Go out with a bang, not hiding and whimpering because Trump won the election. You’ll have our respect.

EDIT: The Supreme Court essentially pardoned Trump for all of his crimes and shielded him from prosecution, and so did the lower courts by the judges Trump installed there, too. If you voted for Trump and you’re self-immolating over this, you’re a hypocrite.  

I’m not advocating for mass criminal action by Biden. But he has the power of the presidency to do more to protect the country from MAGA. That’s all I have to say. ✌️

They want to gut the government and perform a full-on regime change in America. This is the moment conservatives have been working towards for about 50 years. They want electoral autocracy.

Comment: I'm a HS teacher in Los Angeles.  Politics barely register on the minds of most teens, but many of the boys were pro-Trump, or to put it another way anti-Harris.   They blamed Harris for inflation but when I asked them how Trump was going to fix it, they would just stare ahead blankly.

They might be teenagers, but their reaction is typical of the American voter.  Angry, misinformed, and determined to give the establishment the middle finger.
