Comment: News flash for the news outlets out there: trump is fucking unstable.  We know this already.  It’s not news, it’s lived history.  We know what is coming because we have already seen the “so you think you can president” reality tv show before.

Spoilers alert for this season of the show:

1) he will pump and dump the economy which benefits the oligarchs

2) he will prove that his surface level understanding of anything is insufficient to be a decision maker.  we will hear the phase “who knew X was so complicated” where X will be things like tariffs, the economy, healthcare, foreign policy, etc. 

3) there will be many domestic crisis.  Some self inflicted due to lack of knowledge about something or because he put someone in charge of something who is better suited as a mannequin in a Macy’s window display.  

4) there will be one or more global crisis that requires a competent response to avoid tragedy but he will instead seek money making opportunities and political advantage.

5) there will be high turnover in the administration with a revolving door of highly incompetent stooges who have no business in any government position.

6) He will promise to deliver X in two weeks which will never come because he is a liar.

New this season:

* the majority of the functional part of government that affects people daily lives will be fired and replaced by incompetent stooges who swear allegiance to trump and have no other qualifications for jobs that really required skilled players.

Comment: I’m really tired of being gaslit on Reddit about how Trumps first term wasn’t so bad and the next four years will be fine. He is that bad. He’s a giant man baby with the temperament a toddler. He wants to withhold disaster aid from states that are mean to him, purge generals who aren’t loyal enough, jail members of the press who don’t kiss his ass, he’s appointing cabinet members who seem uniquely qualified to destroy their departments. None of this is normal. None of this fine. I’m not overreacting. We knew how much a piece of shit he was in 2020 and we know how much a piece of shit he is now. He’s dumb, vengeful and willing to sell the government to the highest bidder.

Comment: It looks like the next House is going to start with an *extremely* narrow GOP majority, 220 Republicans vs. 215 Democrats, representing a net *loss* of 2 seats for the GOP compared to the 2022 elections. It will be the slimmest House majority in modern history. In addition, Gaetz already resigned, so that's one fewer seat already, and that combined with Stefanik and Waltz joining Trump's administration, and it looks like it will temporarily be a 217R-215D majority, meaning Republicans losing a single vote means the vote will fail. I really don’t think Trump will be able to get much of his legislative priorities achieved through Congress in his second term.

In fact, if it wasn't for 3 seats that North Carolina Republicans gerrymandered into safe GOP districts after the 2022 elections, Democrats would have flipped the House of Representatives by the narrowest 218-217 margin. So much for Trump's "mandate."

Comment: Bits from the [article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-trump-impeachment-vindman-treason-b2654951.html):

&gt;Vindman, who [testified](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-hearing-vindman-williams-ukraine-call-bribery-schiff-a9209721.html) in 2019 that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, cited [reports](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187) that Musk had been engaged in secret conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin dating back to 2022. He then expressed concerns that Musk, who has [federal contracts](https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2024%252F10%252F20%252Fus%252Fpolitics%252Felon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Felon-musk-trump-impeachment-vindman-treason-b2654951.html&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fus-politics%2Felon-musk-trump-impeachment-vindman-treason-b2654951.html&amp;article_id=2654951&amp;author=Justin+Baragona&amp;tag=Elon+Musk%2CAlexander+Vindman%2CDonald+Trump%2CWhite+House&amp;section=World&amp;category=Americas&amp;sub_category=US+politics&amp;updated_time=2024-11-27T21%3A48%3A39.000Z&amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;ref=www.independent.co.uk&amp;utm_source=independent&amp;fbclid=&amp;gclid=) through his SpaceX, Tesla and Starlink companies, may have shared “state secrets” with Putin.

&gt;“And \[Putin’s\] been using the richest man in the world to do his bidding. In some cases, that’s encouraging him probably to support Donald Trump,” Vindman told MSNBC. “That’s not speculation. We see how far in Elon has gone. And then using Twitter as a disinformation platform.”

&gt;Reacting to a [clip](https://x.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1861813646453534823) of Vindman’s remarks, Musk [tweeted](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861820349270335817): “Vindman is on the payroll of Ukrainian oligarchs and has committed treason against the United States, for which he will pay the appropriate penalty.”

&gt;After Vindman first testified before the House impeachment inquiry about Trump’s actions towards Zelensky, Fox News hosts and GOP lawmakers said he “has an affinity for Ukraine” while suggesting he was simultaneously advancing Ukrainian interests while working in the White House. As reported by The Intercept at the time, the [“smear tactic”](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/29/republicans-accuse-colonel-vindman-jew-fled-soviet-persecution-dual-loyalty/) leaned heavily on antisemitic tropes, especially since Vindman himself is Jewish.

&gt;“Vindman is both puppet &amp; puppeteer. Question is who pulls his strings,” Musk wondered in 2022 after Vindman commented on Musk’s purchase of Twitter. “Musk’s tweet — deliberately or not — evoked an antisemitic trope that Jews are puppeteers who secretly wield power over various institutions or that they are puppets of the Israeli government,” *The Jerusalem Post* [observed](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-723510) at the time.

Comment: If this becomes a pandemic, the U.S. response will be so much worse. The culture war on masks and vaccines Republicans started partway through last time will be there from the start now, and an anti vaxxer is in charge now.

Some consolation to me is that the best and quickest vaccines came from Europe last time and probably will this time. So Republicans can't really fuck up the development of the vaccine.

Idiots will prevent vaccinations from protecting a large enough part of the population (again) though, so it wil be a shit show again.

Let's hope it blows over like most of these viruses.

They’ll concoct a conspiracy theory. Make themselves the victim and complain about it.

It’s literally exactly what happened the first time.

Imagine if Trump hadn’t disbanded Obama’s CDC advanced response team to nip potential pandemics in the bud in China?

Imagine if it was taken seriously instead of pretending it didn’t exist during the crucial first months for it to become a pandemic in the first place?

The country that leads global initiatives since WWII was absent and prevented an early, global solution.

The EXACT same thing would happen again and they’ll just create conspiracies about China or birds or Jewish space lasers or whatever it takes to be the victim instead of the culprit. 

I guarantee it.

Trump at his heart is incompetent, selfish and only wants power for the sake of having power. He'd rather be playing golf and having tantrums than actually dealing with the machinations of government. Sure, he might enable a bit of oligarchism and/or fascism and represents the erosion of democratic norms for some people, but this is largely to do with the context around him.

Musk on the other hand is deeply and dangerously ideologically driven and cares far more about tearing down institutions and rebuilding them in his own image. He now has the access and resources to do just that.

Let me tell you the problem our country has.....


People are focusing on the wrong damn thing.  Most of the comments I read were about the need to cut back, be more efficient, etc.


The problem obviously is that this man used his platform to publicize, harass, intimidate 4 government employees that did nothing to him/nothing to deserve what's probably coming to them (harassment, etc.).  Elon will have the crazies after them...all because our open government laws have not caught up to technology (and its capabilities) and he has the power to use his platform to spread information.  



People that work for the government 1. just want to do their job and get paid 2. *might* have decided this line of work because they wanted to help society....  They don't deserve that type of abuse.  People who think they have the solutions to make the government more efficient usually have no clue as to what is going on and why.... These narcissistic pricks need to step back, shut up, learn and respect these people....

Comment: Everyone’s daily reminder that eliminating the Department of Education isn’t an idea unique to MAGA. It has been a Republican goal for a long time.

Anyone remember how Rick Perry’s campaign flamed out in late 2011? “When I’m POTUS, three departments are gone - Education, Commerce, and, uh…”

He campaigned on this and became the frontrunner. It wasn’t this position that cost him. It was his brain fart. 

That same debate, audience members roared their approval at the idea of letting people without health insurance die outside the ER. That’s how morally bankrupt the GOP and its voters are and have been since way before Trump.

EDIT - not the same debate it turns out, they were a couple months apart. “Oops”, as Rick Perry would say! 🤷😬

But in their stupidity, they don’t realize that in a capitalist society, a company only exists to make money for a very small subset of people (that doesn’t even include most of the corporate drones). 

A government is supposed to exist to serve the populace. All of the populace. And while we can argue about deficit operating, a government really shouldn’t exist to make excess wealth. Because then who controls that excess wealth? We used to call those people kings and queens.

Check out the $3.5 billion one they put in Peru.  The way China has been making deals and securing resource rights in Brazil, Chile, and other Latin American countries at an alarming rate should be of major concern.

Comment: And in the other uncalled California House race, Democrat Adam Gray just [pulled ahead of Republican incumbent John Duarte by 182 votes](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/california-us-house-district-13-results)! This means that if Democrats flip both seats, Republicans will only have won 220 seats in the House, representing a net *loss* of 2 seats compared to the 2022 elections. It looks like the GOP will have the slimmest House majority in modern history (and they're also about to lose 3 seats temporarily as Trump makes cabinet appointments). I don’t think Trump will be able to get much of his legislative priorities achieved through Congress in his second term.

In fact, if it wasn't for 3 seats that North Carolina Republicans gerrymandered into safe GOP districts after the 2022 elections, Democrats would have flipped the House of Representatives by the narrowest 218-217 margin. So much for Trump's "mandate."
